1	1990	NVSQ	19:01	Children as Citizens in Training: Political Socialization for a Strong Democracy	"The author analyzed the content of three popular prime-time television programs and the California state school system's social science curriculum to determine their possible effect on the development of political efficacy in children. The findings were checked by conducting focus groups with children. This exploratory research suggests that participation in a youth service organization is a more potent agent for the transference of knowledge, values, and skills relating to political efficacy and civic voluntarism than either television or formal education."
2	1990	NVSQ	19:01	Volunteers Life-Styles: Market Segmentation Based on Volunteers Role Choices	"This study applies market segmentation techniques to the problem of volunteer recruitment and retention in nonprofit voluntary organizations. Four types of volunteer roles are studied: direct service, leadership, general support, and member-at-large. A mail survey is analyzed, and the conclusion is reached that the volunteer market can be meaningfully segmented and that knowledge of volunteers differing life-styles can lead to the effective targeting of particular groups."
3	1990	NVSQ	19:01	Privatization and Its Impact on Nonprofit Service Providers	"This paper examines privatization as a multidimensional phenomenon that has broad ramifications for the planning, funding, and provision of human services. Historical changes in the balance of public and private services and the current expansion of the private sector's role are reviewed. A conceptual framework illustrates dynamics brought on by privatization that may lead to increased inter-agency competition for contract-eligible and fee-for-service clients. The paper concludes with a discussion of the potential effect of these dynamics on clients who cannot pay."
4	1990	NVSQ	19:01	"Multiple Forms of Volunteer Activity in the Public Sector: Functional, Structural, and Policy Dimensions"	"Growing use of volunteers in public programs has outstripped our understanding of the behavioral, structural, and policy effects of citizen inputs of time, fiscal resources, and influence. A reconsideration of the functional roles of volunteers and their linkages with public agencies is needed."
5	1990	NVSQ	19:01	Responsibility for Critical Events in Nonprofit Organizations	The commonplace view of nonprofit organizations sees the board in control and responsible for the governance and outcomes of important events in the organization. This point of view is empirically examined by analyzing how chief executives of nonprofit organizations and their board presidents attribute responsibility for outcomes of critical incidents. The results suggest both chief executives and board presidents believe in the psychological centrality of the chief executive in a hierarchy of responsibility for organizational outcomes. The authors discuss how those in responsible positions in nonprofit organizations come to understand and explain the reality of their organizational experience and raise the implications for a theory of nonprofit organizations.
6	1990	NVSQ	19:02	Corporate Philanthropy: Strategic Responses to the Firm's Stakeholders	"Corporate decisions about philanthropic contributions have become more strategic in recent years. Contributions aim not only to benefit recipient nonprofit organizations but also to fulfill major business objectives. This article develops a typology of strategic corporate philanthropy that distinguishes between strategic process and three strategic outcomes. It reports the extent of strategic philanthropy categories in an exploratory study of large firms headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area. Relationships between strategic philanthropy and industry sector, organizational placement of the philanthropy function, firm age, and firm size are identified."
7	1990	NVSQ	19:02	Realigning Corporate Giving: Problems in the Nonprofit Sector for Community Development Corporations	"Corporate philanthropy is set in the context of local political economy. This study of corporate giving in a mid-South city finds that community development is not a priority for giving, despite its place in neighborhood and citywide political agendas. Corporate support remains centered on established nonprofit organizations with concerns for traditional charity and service."
8	1990	NVSQ	19:02	Motivational Differences Between Black and White Volunteers	"Several studies have suggested that both altruistic and egoistic motivations help to explain why people choose to volunteer. These theories have been applied universally without regard to cultural differences among volunteer groups. To refine these theories, comparisons were performed between black and white volunteers of a Big Brothers/Big Sisters agency in a southwestern city. The black volunteers were significantly more likely to report altruistic reasons for volunteering than their white counterparts."
9	1990	NVSQ	19:02	Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Economics: A Critical Survey	"Two areas of study have sparked new interest in the economics profession : the economics of organization in general and the economics of the nonprofit organization in particular. The new economics of organization applies standard (neoclassical) analysis but concentrates on the incentives to individuals within organizations and on how those incentives affect their behavior. Economists have also begun studying what nonprofit enterprises do, why they are formed, how they operate, and how well they perform. Although the neoclassical paradigm is inclusive enough to incorporate the study of the non profit sector, economists must be careful to reexamine their assumptions in using it."
10	1990	NVSQ	19:02	Labor Economics and the Nonprofit Sector: A Literature Review	The economics literature on nonprofit utilization of employees and volunteers is reviewed and synthesized. Economic motivations for volunteering and accepting volunteers are explored along with inter actions between gifts of time and of money and the economic value of volunteer labor. Also examined are factors explaining wage differences between the nonprofit and for-profit sectors and the differential employment of women and minorities.
11	1990	NVSQ	19:02	The Effect of Competition on Labor Management in Nonprofit Organizations	"Recent theories of formal organization have argued that the external environment has a determinant effect on organizational behavior and structure. Executives of 104 nonprofit human service organizations in a medium-sized city were surveyed to study the effect of perceived competition for scarce resources on labor management practices. Many executives perceived their environment to be both cooperative and competitive, most had adopted rational management procedures. No significant effect of competition on management was found."
12	1990	NVSQ	19:03	"Voluntarism, Nongovernmental Organizations, and Public Policy in the Third Reich"	Welfare institutions under Nazi rule have not been subject to sociological inquiry. The meager scientific interest in nongovernmental welfare institutions and the scanty knowledge about the role of voluntary welfare associations in the Nazi period are not proof of a clean slate.
13	1990	NVSQ	19:03	State and Welfare Groups: Competition or Cooperation? Some Observations on the Israeli Scene	"Voluntary welfare associations (VWAs) act both as pressure groups transmitting demands from citizens to state and as functional groups cooperating with government in the formulation and implementation of public policies. Pressure is employed within the pluralist configuration, in which VWAs retain their autonomy vis-ö-vis the state. Concerted action and partnership between state and associations occur under corporatism. In each model, a certain cost-benefit balance emerges. Under corporatism, the state devolves power in order to obtain legitimacy, associations forfeit their autonomy in order to gain integrated participation. Under pluralism, the state trades power for legitimacy, associations retain their autonomy at the expense of participation in decision making. This article examines the relevance of these ideas to the Israeli context. The corporatist relationship was expected to prevail when VWAs performed primary functions. When they fulfilled complementary roles, the relationship should tend to be pluralistic. These expectations were examined on eight VWAs, divided equally between the health (primary) and the handicapped (complementary) domains."
14	1990	NVSQ	19:03	Voluntary Organizations and Public Incentive Systems: A Norwegian Case	"This article discusses the role and significance of public policy and financial incentive systems for voluntary adult education organizations in Norway. The discussion focuses on the public policy goal of social commitment through equalization and the functioning of the voluntary organizations in relation to this goal. Ideals and realities are examined, and paradoxes or dilemmas related to the promotion of public policy objectives are outlined."
15	1990	NVSQ	19:03	Israeli and U.S. Orientations Toward Self-Help Groups for Families in Crisis	"This article explores the orientations toward self-help and mutual support groups held by people facing family crises in the United States and Israel. People from four different kinds of self-help groups in the two nations Parents of Children with Cancer and Parents of Murdered Children, from the United States, and Parents of Mentally Ill Children and Members of Families of New Immigrants, from Israel report on the kinds of activities and programs that their self-help and mutual support groups undertake and on the benefits that they receive from participation. The results indicate that these voluntary organizations can be helpful to people facing family crises. Further analysis distinguishes the differential impact on these reports of the types of family crises involved and the national cultures and social service systems of Israel and the United States."
16	1990	NVSQ	19:03	Activity Areas and Developmental Stages in Self-Help Groups	"This article reports on four and a half years of participant observation in two self-help associations, a Gray Panthers group and a Parents Circle of Young Drug Abusers. As the first step of our analysis, we developed a classification system for the activities of these groups (self-maintenance, mutual aid, socializing, voluntary work, and lobbying). This helped us to identify and characterize five developmental stages (solidarization, orientation, stabilization, differentiation, and institutionalization of one or more activity areas). We describe the development of the two groups and their transformation over time, suggest some hypotheses for further research, and discuss some implications of the results."
17	1990	NVSQ	19:03	Tax Expenditures: A Criticism of the Concept as Applied to Nongovernmental Organizations	"The concept of tax expenditures has become increasingly important during the last decade, and it may have far-reaching consequences for tax policy on nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). This article challenges the concept of tax expenditures as it is often applied to NGOs that operate as nonprofits. It argues that the concept is too vague and general to be applied to third sector organizations. Tax expenditure analysis lacks the theoretical basis necessary to classify most tax provisions. Any deviations from the chosen, so-called general (normative or reference) rules of taxation are too easily classified as a subsidy or transference from the government to the NGO. This subsidy perspective on NGOs oversimplifies the complex economic relationship between NGOs and the government. The article suggests some guidelines that can be applied in discussions of tax provisions and exemptions of relevance to NGOs."
18	1990	NVSQ	19:03	Methodological Issues in Studying the Effectiveness of Nongovernmental and Nonprofit Organizations	"Many theoretical and methodological difficulties have limited the development of research on the effectiveness of nonprofit organizations. After reviewing contemporary approaches to the task of defining and distinguishing among voluntary, nonprofit organizations, this article suggests several workable indicators that can advance research into effectiveness, especially if they are used in combination. It also presents and illustrates the uses of Boolean algebra as an analytical technique that promises to enhance comparative case study research."
19	1990	NVSQ	19:04	Expanding the Government-by- Proxy Construct: Volunteers in the Delivery of Public Services	Government by proxy the use of third parties rather than government employees and organizations to deliver publicly funded services is on the increase. Volunteers constitute one of the third parties through which governments fulfill important service responsibilities. This article discusses the advantages of this form of government by proxy as well as the implications of volunteer involvement for public management.
20	1990	NVSQ	19:04	Citizens Serving Government: The Extent and Distinctiveness of Volunteer Participation in Local Public Agencies	"This article examines the extent of volunteer participation in local government agencies, the distinctiveness of those volunteers in contrast to volunteers to other types of organizations, and the impact on public organizations by volunteers. A review of recent research indicates that volunteers can have a significant impact on the organizational practices and outcomes of local public agencies."
21	1990	NVSQ	19:04	Comparison of Volunteers in Public and Nonprofit Human Service Agencies	"In recent years, there has been a blurring of the traditional boundaries between the public and the nonpublic (for-profit and voluntary nonprofit) sectors. Studies in volunteerism to date have not yet addressed the issue of differences and similarities of volunteers in public and nonpublic agencies. In this article, we report on the first empirical study conducted of volunteers from the public and nonprofit sectors."
22	1990	NVSQ	19:04	"Volunteer Fire and Rescue Corporations: Structure, Process, and Survival"	"This article outlines the structure and process of volunteer fire and emergency medical corporations from a theoretical and practical perspective. Practical implications for the survival of these organizations are discussed namely, strategies for increasing participation of minorities and building rational coproductive relationships between corporations and local government."
23	1990	NVSQ	19:04	Themes in International Research on the Nonprofit Sector	"This article outlines major characteristics of the nonprofit sector in civil law, common law, socialist countries, and developing countries. Largely based on an international directory of nonprofit sector research, the article introduces common and country-specific research themes on the nonprofit sector in a comparative perspective. The article concludes by delineating several implications for research in the areas of taxonomy, measurement, intersectoral relations, and comparative institutional history."
24	1990	NVSQ	19:04	The Independence of Voluntary Organizations in a Social Democracy: Governmental Influences in Norway	"In spite of strong traditions favoring self-assuring voluntary organizations, in the Norwegian social democracy there is a development toward less independence in this sector. Increasing reliance on indirect taxation to finance the welfare state has put greater financial strain on formerly so-called tax-exempt organizations. In addition, large portions of the relatively detailed welfare state legislation do not take into account the special conditions of voluntary organizations, which therefore often become dependent on the leniency of enforcing agencies and tend increasingly to become more like quasi-governmental agencies."
25	1991	NVSQ	20:01	Managing Grants and Contracts: The Case of Four Nonprofit Social Service Organizations	"Nonprofit organizations face complex problems in managing resources on a continuing basis because their funding sources differ greatly in structure and predictability. Case studies of four nonprofit social service agencies, representing key theoretical dimensions from models of organizational behavior, show how the agencies relate to different funding sources and manage the challenges they present. Donations and government funding vary in their predictability and in the scope of management work they demand, such funding contingencies impede strategic planning and can drain other organizational resources. Funding relationships involve government agencies and nonprofit organizations in a system of mutual dependence."
26	1991	NVSQ	20:01	Commercial Venturing and the Transformation of America's Voluntary Social Welfare Agencies	"This article examines venturing, or the commercial sale of services and products, as a strategy employed by voluntary social agencies to bolster their faltering budgets. It reports the findings of a descriptive study of a population of 101 such agencies in greater Philadelphia. The authors suggest that the increase in commercial ventures by nonprofits is to some extent a by-product of the expansion of government contracting in the social welfare field. They conclude that even when successful, commercial ventures pose significant risks to nonprofit agencies."
27	1991	NVSQ	20:01	Participation in Policy Determination by Registered Nurses in Not-for-Profit and Proprietary Facilities	"It is generally assumed in the not-for-profit literature that when not-for profit and proprietary facilities coexist in the same industry, workers generally have a preference for employment in not-for-profit facilities. A question arises, however, as to whether the work environment is better in not-for-profit facilities. This article examines this issue, using data from the 1985 National Nursing Home Survey. Our results indicate that while the degree of participation in policy determination by registered nurses is greater in proprietary facilities than not-for-profit facilities, once personal and institutional controls are introduced, the effect of type of ownership on the degree of policy determination by registered nurses becomes insignificant. The main factor producing the gross differentials is found to be the larger average size of not-for-profit institutions."
28	1991	NVSQ	20:01	The Roots of Voluntary Agencies: A Question of Choice	"This article presents a conceptual framework for exploring the development of voluntary organizations. The first part of the theory distinguishes business and public bureaucracies from associations and defines the agency as a hybrid or ambiguous organization. The second part of the theory analyzes the system of roots of voluntary agencies, which is defined as the relationship between implicit welfare policy, financial resources, and human resources. It is suggested that voluntary agency development can be understood, and therefore planned, by examining its root system and that severe imbalances among operational explanations, root system, and governing body can lead to many familiar problems."
29	1991	NVSQ	20:01	Skill Transferal Benefits from Volunteer Experiences	"With increasing frequency, professional and popular publications contain references to or case studies about women who have made a successful transition from volunteer to paid employment through the use of skills learned through their volunteer work. This article describes how a selected sample of individuals in Virginia was able to transfer volunteer-developed skills to paid employment. It also provides information about the extent to which subjects were able to get college credit based on volunteer-developed knowledge and skills and introduces the concept that such skills may also be useful in initiating self-employment or obtaining supplemental income."
30	1991	NVSQ	20:01	Not-for-Profit Organizations in the Soviet Union: Turning On Some Lights	"This article describes the fledgling state and growth of not-for-profit organizations in the Soviet Union. The buoyant reappearance of this sector can be seen as a response to the legitimized recognition of gaps in service delivery at a time when social, political, and economic changes under perestroika create openings for new initiatives, which challenge the monolithic system in place. As such, not-for-profits reflect state failure and, at the same time, tentative movements toward a civic society. Some continuity with prerevolutionary practices and institutions is noted."
31	1991	NVSQ	20:01	"Political Culture, Nonprofit Organizations, and the Financing of Human Services"	"Students of fiscal policy have long noted the impact political culture has on spending levels. This relationship has not only been statistically demonstrated but is incorporated in the stereotypical views held of certain areas. Some states are frequently identified as low spenders, while others have a reputation for supporting services. When the federal government elected to reduce its support for many human services, an opportunity arose to understand whether political cultures had changed in some areas with regard to state and local support of human services. In states where the tradition was for low spending for services, did they respond by curtailing programs, or did the public or private sectors increase their spending? In Texas, a state with a history of low spending levels for human services, neither the state legislature nor local governments increased their fiscal responsibilities for human services. However, there was a large increase in private sector contributions. The pattern of this response not only sheds new light on the political culture of Texas but also raises important challenges for financing nonprofit agencies and delivering human services."
32	1991	NVSQ	20:02	Four Sectors or Five? Retaining the Member-Benefit Sector	"The sectors of society include not only the government, business, and nonprofit sectors but also the personal (expanded household) sector. The nonprofit sector is the fourth (and, if necessary, fifth) sector, not the third sector. Either the membership sector (member-serving nonprofits) is recognized as a significant part of the nonprofit sector more adequately, or it should be seen as a fifth sector."
33	1991	NVSQ	20:02	Varieties of Activism in Three Western Democracies	"A cross-cultural comparison of the characteristics of activists and initiators in three modes of action indicates that civic attitudes, group mobilization, and capacities are more important than dissatisfaction and values as backgrounds of activism. Although the three modes of direct action tend to be applied in different situations, they also have much in common. Instead of distinguishing unconventional from conventional participation, one might speak of varieties of activism."
34	1991	NVSQ	20:02	Neighborhood Needs and Organizational Resources: New Lessons from Detroit	"Despite declining conditions in many U.S. urban neighborhoods, some people have organized and planned programs and services at the neighborhood level. This article reports research designed to assess the scope and quality of participation in neighborhood organizations in Detroit, one of the nation's most seriously distressed cities. The findings suggest that although people participate in organizations with a wide range of activities and accomplishments, their leaders perceive that neighborhood problems are worsening and that neighborhood participation and organizational resources are not necessarily enough to reverse decline."
35	1991	NVSQ	20:02	Self-Help Groups Providing Services: Conflict and Change	"Since 1963, the lives of thousands of psychiatric patients in the United States have been drastically and dramatically changed by a national policy change to community-based mental health care. Faults in the implementation of that policy have often placed the burden of care for these patients in the hands of their families. Several years ago, a self-help group composed of parents of chronically mentally ill adults founded two small residential facilities for their patient-children. One facility was intended to be an innovative attempt to provide care for this population but quickly became a facility like those established by professionals. The other facility unintentionally preserved the model of the first. This study looks at the development of the parents self-help group, the two facilities, and the conflicts that developed because of these attempts to provide formal services to the mentally ill."
36	1991	NVSQ	20:02	Trustee Motivation and Board Effectiveness	"This article describes the relationship between governing boards effectiveness in private colleges and the specie factors that motivate trustees to join and serve on boards. Far more often among members of effective rather than ineffective boards, trustees motives are institution-specific and institution-centered, springing from deep affection and a sense of connection to the college. Research results are analyzed in terms of three motivational frameworks, none of which is capable of reflecting the differences in motivation that distinguish members of effective boards. We offer a rudimentary new framework for differentiating boards on the basis of the extent of trustees identification with the institution."
37	1991	NVSQ	20:02	"Relationships Among Market Work, Work Aspirations, and Volunteering: The Case of Retired Women"	"Work by economists offers differing explanations for the volunteer participation of women. Mueller argues that women volunteer as a stepping- stone to employment in the market. Blau argues that, because of the constraints women face, volunteer activity serves as a substitute for work in the market. A synthesized view argues that both the substitution and the stepping-stone hypotheses help explain volunteer behavior. This paper examines whether such a synthesized view is consistent with the experiences of retired women, using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. The empirical results strongly support the idea that retired women volunteer as a substitute for market work. The results are also consistent with the idea that some women may use volunteer participation as a stepping-stone to work in the market."
38	1991	NVSQ	20:03	Organized Philanthropy's Response to AIDS	"In many ways philanthropy, more than government, has risen to the challenge of responding to AIDS. Still, the private response has not been uniform. Instead, it has been conditioned by a number of factors, both internal and external to foundation and corporate donor communities. What can be learned from philanthropy's response to AIDS during the first decade of the epidemic?"
39	1991	20:03	20:03	The Volunteer Response to the AIDS Epidemic in New York City: Implications for Research on Voluntarism	"This article examines changes in the demand for voluntary labor, focusing on how volunteers were mobilized to provide services in response to the AIDS epidemic in New York City. It considers how social change modifies the demand for voluntary labor and the distribution of unpaid workers in various types of jobs and organizations. The volunteer response to AIDS was shaped by a number of different historical, cultural, and political factors. The study also suggests ways researchers could broaden their focus on the motivations of volunteers and the place of voluntarism in American life."
40	1991	20:03	20:03	Gay AIDS Voluntarism as Political Activity	"In a number of respects, the voluntary response of New York City's sizable gay community to AIDS, through Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC), has been unique. In addition to its important advocacy and service-providing functions, the work of GMHC assumed significant political dimensions that served to counter discrimination, empower the organization's adherents, and help preserve their sense of community in the face of a medical and social catastrophe."
41	1991	20:03	20:03	Inequity and Power in the Nonprofit Sector: A Comparative Analysis of AIDS-Related Services for Gay Men and Intravenous Drug Users in Chicago	"The nonprofit AIDS service system in Chicago serves gay men better than it serves intravenous drug users. This inequity is related to differences in power of the groups of actors involved. Recommendations are made for the development of a nonprofit sector response to the second wave of AIDS, which is characterized by increased infection among intra venous drug users. Much can be gained in paying more attention to the concept of power in the theory of the role of the nonprofit sector."
42	1991	20:03	20:03	The Citizens Commission on AIDS: A Private-Sector Response to an Epidemic	"The Citizens Commission on AIDS for New York City and Northern New Jersey was created by a consortium of foundations to stimulate private-sector leadership in the region. Its activities included creating and seeking endorsements for a set of principles on AIDS and the workplace, advocating more drug-treatment facilities and community-based alternatives to hospital care, and continuing support for prevention and education. The commission format has advantages as well as disadvantages, which are explored in this case study."
43	1991	NVSQ	20:04	On Sharing: A Preface to an Economic Theory of Voluntary Action	"This article constitutes a preface to an economic foundation of a theory of the voluntary sector-the share economy. The paper is divided into four sections. The first section is concerned with sharing as an alternative mode of interaction in a society, differing from two-way exchange and one-way transfer transactions and constituting an important element in building up communities. The analysis emphasizes the importance of certain types of goods requiring sharing. The characteristics of these goods, which are referred to here as collective goods, are explored in the second section. The third section shows that, from the point of view of social and economic efficiency, the production of collective goods will have to be assumed at least partially by a special economic sector termed the voluntary sector. Therefore, the voluntary sector and the transaction of sharing play a significant role in the allocation of resources comparable to the role assumed by the institutions of the market (exchange sector) and government (transfer sector). A concluding remark discusses some political ramifications of the economy of the voluntary sector."
44	1991	NVSQ	20:04	Issues of Accountability in Health Charities: A Case Study of Accountability Problems Among Nonprofit Organizations	"Although record amounts of money and other resources are being donated to American charities, few discussions focus on the issue of accountability. This article attempts to lay the framework for such a discussion by examining charitable health organizations as a case study. Such issues as fiscal responsibility, fund-raising, organizational structure, and political lobbying are explored in an effort to define the problems that surround the concept of accountability in the nonprofit sector."
45	1991	NVSQ	20:04	Permanent Disaster Volunteers: Where Do They Fit?	"Voluntary action scholars and disaster researchers have paid little attention to the permanent volunteer in the context of large-scale social crisis. In contrast, there have been many studies on particular types of volunteering behavior in the everyday setting, such as bystander intervention, while many other studies have explored the personality profile and organizational settings of full-time career emergency workers, such as police, ambulance, and fire officers. The comparative lack of systematic inquiry on disaster volunteerism has implications for countries like Australia, where the disaster management system relies heavily on a trained and readily available unpaid citizenry. In particular, little practical material is currently available that deals with the management of permanent volunteers as a specific emergency worker group. In an effort to remedy this imbalance and encourage further study of this group, this article explores the characteristics of permanent disaster volunteerism and their location within the existing knowledge framework of volunteerism and voluntary organizations."
46	1991	NVSQ	20:04	Voluntary Organizations in Developing Countries and Colonial Societies: The Social Service Department of the Palestine Jewish Community in the 1930s	"Voluntary organizations may serve somewhat different functions in developing countries and colonial societies than they do in more developed countries. In all societies, voluntary organizations engage in social action in order to make their governments more responsive to the social needs and political rights of the population, but this function is especially crucial in societies where there is no access to the political decision-making structures. This case study explores yet another role for the voluntary organization: the deliberate and planful utilization of a voluntary organization structure to prepare for self-government and political independence. The establishment and early years of operation of the Social Service Department of the Jewish National Council in British-ruled Palestine in the 1930s serves as the example."
47	1991	NVSQ	20:04	Contracted Services: Issues for the Nonprofit Agency Manager	This article reports the findings of one of the few studies to examine how administrators in nonprofit agencies manage contracted services. The analytic framework for explaining and describing managers experience is their primary metaphor: contracted services as a game.
48	1991	NVSQ	20:04	A Methodology for Measuring the Financial Vulnerability of Charitable Nonprofit Organizations	"This article defines a charitable nonprofit organization as financially vulnerable if it is likely to cut service offerings immediately when a financial shock occurs. It discusses why the vulnerability of the nonprofit sector is of interest to researchers, explores the destabilizing role of third-party finance, considers the reasons for the lack of research on vulnerability, and presents a conceptual framework for identifying financially vulnerable nonprofits. Four vulnerability criteria are defined and applied to a 1983 national sample of tax returns filed by 4,730 U.S. charitable nonprofits. The financial data of at-risk organizations are then analyzed to discern the characteristics of vulnerable and other nonprofit organizations."
49	1992	NVSQ	21:01	Volunteerism: The Self-Regarding and Other-Regarding Aspects of the Human Spirit	"Volunteerism develops from two fundamental human inclinations: the self-regarding inclination, which focuses on creative human powers, and the other-regarding tendency, which focuses on altruistic human powers. It is crucial to recognize the primary nature of freedom of choice in the voluntary act. In that regard, volunteering becomes an important spiritual act of human beings."
50	1992	NVSQ	21:01	Volunteering and Empowerment in Secondary Schools	"This study explores the rationales for and consequences of voluntary community participation in the life of a school. Thirty-one teachers and volunteers from three schools were identified and formally interviewed. The six types of involvement reported were found to be more needs-based when participants were asked about the rationales of others. Women reported more personal and social rationales, men more instrumental rationales, personal empowerment was a fundamental consequence of involvement, and the situational characteristics of volunteers were essential to under standing their personal needs and sources of empowerment. The findings challenge the institutional rationale, support the idea that volunteers can achieve altruistic and egoistic goals simultaneously, and affirm a belief in lifelong education."
51	1992	NVSQ	21:01	"A Commission to Change: The United Methodist Church in Detroit, Michigan, 1950-1980"	"In the last decade, nonprofit organizations have become the focus of much inquiry and research. Before Reagan's invitation to volunteer, before Bush's Thousand Points of Light, the United Methodist Church in Detroit was behaving as a nonprofit organization bent on changing its urban environment. Although sincere attempts were made to influence its community and congregations, the church often responded to external pressures by readjusting its goals, thereby diminishing the potential for significant, long-lasting social or political change. Like other nonprofit organizations, the United Methodist Church, limited by its size and its dependence on voluntary contributions, organizational democracy, and organizational networks, was more often a respondent to change than an agent of change."
52	1992	NVSQ	21:01	Enterprise in Religious-Based Organizations	"Personal interviews of representatives of selected Jewish and Christian religious organizations yielded data on 105 commercial enterprises. Four case studies illustrate the types of religious enterprise that were identified. The sacred and secular dimensions of the assets and constraints that affect management in religious enterprise are also discussed. Sacred assets identified include committed leadership and staff, committed constituents, volunteers, working environment/spiritual vision, and spiritual tools. Tax exemption was identified as a secular asset. Sacred constraints identified were religious laws and imperatives, mission conflict, and refusal to exploit supporters. Secular constraints include staff compensation, limited business experience, and threatened loss of tax exemption."
53	1992	NVSQ	21:01	Attitudes Toward Homeless Persons of Those Attending New York City Community Board Meetings	"Attitudes toward homeless persons were studied in persons attending community board meetings in New York City. For these respondents, direct contact with homeless persons and occupation characterized as professional were the most important variables related to favorable attitudes toward homeless persons and the establishment of shelters. Results were compared with those of a previous study of persons employed in New York, for whom information gained from media was most related to attitudes."
54	1992	NVSQ	21:01	"National Nonprofit, Voluntary Associations: Some Parameters"	"A sample of national nonprofit organizations drawn from the national Encyclopedia of Associations (1988) is examined. Principal findings include that these organizations have recently grown at 3.6 percent per year, are mainly work or leisure oriented, have a mean age of eighteen years (younger than in a 1975 study), have mainly individual (rather than organizational) memberships, a median size of 445 (much higher for individuals than organizations), and small staffs (median estimated to be zero), and show declining concentration in the Washington, D.C., New York City, and Chicago metropolitan areas as a set (but a rise in Washington, D.C., locations). Some interpretations of the data are offered."
55	1992	NVSQ	21:01	Active Members in Nuclear Repository Issues Organizations: A Demographic Research Note	"Leaders and active members of social movement organizations concerned with the Hanford Nuclear Repository in a rural area of eastern Washing ton State have been surveyed. To comprehend better the demographic characteristics of the active members of environmental organizations, a case study was developed. Hypotheses were formed and tested. The results suggest that well-educated, low-to-middle-income marginal persons who are underemployed and seeking meaning in their lives form the active membership of environmental movement organizations. Further in-depth analysis of membership characteristics is necessary to test the results reported in this research note."
56	1992	NVSQ	21:02	Local Human Services Provision by Religious Congregations: A Community Analysis	"This study examines how religious congregations in one community responded to the new federalism of the Reagan era. One hundred and twenty-eight congregations were surveyed to determine their participation in three post-budget cut community-based programs. Findings show the various levels of involvement, including volunteering, giving money, and donating goods. The article also explores the factors that contribute to community outreach by religious congregations."
57	1992	NVSQ	21:02	Ideology or Pragmatism? Further Reflections on Voluntary and Public Sector Relations in the Nineteenth Century	"Cooperation between the public and voluntary sectors is not a new phenomenon but was already common in the nineteenth century. Then as now, the boundaries between the two sectors were not clearly defined. The extent of interpenetration and shared activities has been underestimated or ignored by many, but there is abundant evidence to suggest that nineteenth-century Americans did not hesitate to request and use governmental help, just as government had no qualms about using private organizations to carry out many of its welfare responsibilities. All levels of government (local, state, and federal) were involved in various relationships with voluntary organizations. Selected data to support this proposition are presented. This commingling of public and private sector activities has become a characteristic of American society, but the concern over the relationship between these sectors persists. Possible reasons for this continuing concern, as well as implications for contemporary welfare issues, are explored."
58	1992	NVSQ	21:02	Hispanic Nonprofit Organizations in the State of California	"This article presents an initial assessment of the numbers and functions of nonprofit organizations within the California Hispanic community, whose population will soon constitute one-third of the state total. The changing social and political realities accompanying rapid population growth have stimulated a notable expansion in numbers and kinds of nonprofit groups. Changing realities have also motivated key organizations to replace older, piecemeal approaches to community problems with regional and strategic ones."
59	1992	NVSQ	21:02	Explaining Changes in the Population of Voluntary Organizations: The Roles of Aggregate and Individual Level Data	"This article demonstrates the simultaneous need for time-series and multilevel data in order to understand organizational transformation. It is based on data from an extensive research project on voluntary organizations that encompassed the total registration of nongovernmental organizations in a Norwegian province at three different times. Theoretical and methodological problems concerning organizational theory in general, and population ecology in particular, are identified."
60	1992	NVSQ	21:02	Voluntary Association Boards: A Reflection of Member and Community Characteristics?	"This study examines U.S. affiliates of an international voluntary association (Habitat for Humanity) and the relationship of local board composition, membership composition, and community characteristics. Using survey and census data, we were interested in whether characteristics of the local community are important predictors of the types of members recruited and the kinds of persons who emerge as voluntary organization leaders. We found that the characteristics of the local community influence composition and the size of membership and boards of directors. Additionally, we found that membership composition is also related to board composition."
61	1992	NVSQ	21:03	Taking the Strain of Change: U.K. Local Voluntary Agencies Enter the Post-Thatcher Period	"This article draws together the findings from a program of research undertaken in the United Kingdom during the decade 1980-1990 (the Thatcher period). Using an analytic framework that distinguishes among the activities of agencies, their implicit welfare policies, organizational structures, governance systems, and human and financial resources, this article explores changes in the work of local voluntary and nonprofit agencies. Major changes in each of these dimensions are identified, and the relationships among them are discussed. The broad objective of the article is to increase understanding of the underlying structures of voluntary agencies."
62	1992	NVSQ	21:03	"Do Nonprofit Boards Make a Difference? An Exploration of the Relationships Among Board Structure, Process, and Effectiveness"	"The contribution of board structure and process dynamics to organizational and board effectiveness is the focus of this article. Based on data collected from a cross section of Canadian nonprofit organizations, the results show a positive association between the perception of board effectiveness and the use of many of the most widely advocated prescriptions on how a nonprofit board of directors should operate. However, when objective indicators of organizational performance are examined, the link between performance and board behaviors is found to be more limited."
63	1992	NVSQ	21:03	"A Neglected Type of Voluntary Nonprofit Organization: Exploration of the Semiformal, Fluid-Membership Organization"	"The semiformal organization is identified as a neglected type of voluntary nonprofit organization. It is characterized by having no defined members or by treating as members any participants and by having an informal leadership structure and operation. Data from qualitative and quantitative research on local voluntary organizations in a small suburb confirm the presence of semiformal organizations (36 percent of the fifty-nine organizations sampled) and indicate some of their correlates (including fewer officers, more open membership, fewer affiliates, and younger participants). The construct is especially important in measuring accurately the size of voluntary organizations. It is important to find out whether semi formal organization is a necessary phase in the development of voluntary organizations and what affects the transition to a fully formal organization. For many semiformal organizations, informality seems an enduring characteristic, not just a stage."
64	1992	NVSQ	21:03	Differences in Personal Goals and Attitudes Among Volunteers	"Using data from a national survey, this article analyzes the relationship between volunteering and attitudes regarding personal goals, the role and responsibility of government, the charitable responsibility of individuals, and confidence in charitable and noncharitable institutions. It focuses on the differences between volunteers and nonvolunteers and between volunteers to organizations operating under three different auspices (public, for-profit, and nonprofit) and in eleven different types of volunteer activities. The findings reveal that, when controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and social roles, statistically significant differences in personal goals and attitudes exist between volunteers and nonvolunteers, as well as among volunteers found in the three sectors and in various types of activities."
65	1992	NVSQ	21:03	Researchers and Practitioners in Nonprofit Organization and Voluntary Action: Applying Research to Practice?	"Based on a survey of the professed needs of a large sample of volunteer administrators for research and a comprehensive analysis of the topics addressed over an extended period in a leading journal on voluntarism, this article examines the correspondence between the preferences of one group of practitioners and the interests of researchers in voluntarism. The analysis shows that the relationship between the needs of these practitioners and the publication interests of the researchers is neither as tenuous as some would fear nor as strong as others would like. If increasing the relevance of the research literature for volunteer administrators is a priority, several means lie well within reach to forge firmer ties to the practitioner community."
66	1992	NVSQ	21:03	"The Commons: A Multidisciplinary Approach to Nonprofit Organization, Voluntary Action, and Philanthropy"	"The task of identifying nonprofit organizations, voluntary action, and philanthropy as the principal constituents of a single sector within the larger economy, society, and polity has been a central challenge for the multidisciplinary paradigm that seems to be emerging in this field. The concepts of the commons and common goods are presented in this article as having important multidisciplinary implications. The commons is characterized by uncoerced participation, shared purposes and resources, mutuality, and fairness, the derivative concept of common goods is characterized as desirable ends that are universal and indivisible within a commons but not necessarily beyond. Taken together, the concepts of the commons and common goods offer the basis for a shared paradigm that can resolve the sector problem."
67	1992	NVSQ	21:04	Adoption and Altruism: Those with Whom I Want to Share a Dream	"This article reviews findings from a study on philanthropy among the wealthy, with a special emphasis on adoption philanthropy. Attempts to define altruism from deductive philosophical or theoretical reasoning are destined to disappoint, and a positive understanding of altruism must be gleaned from an inductive examination of adoption philanthropy. Recent considerations on altruism have shifted the debate from the rational dismissal of altruism to an exploration of its existence as part of human nature (Piliavin and Charng, 1990). This change in analytic perspective implies that the study of altruism can now be moved further into the sociological arena by constructing it in terms of emotion, taste, moral sentiment, and normative orientation. That is, altruism can be viewed not just as a part of human nature (as anthropology and sociobiology have indicated) but as part of moral biography and identity."
68	1992	NVSQ	21:04	Uncompensated Costs and Indigent Health Care: Volunteers and a Community Services Budget	"With thirty-seven million people now without medical insurance, private insurers have argued that caring for those unable to pay for the services they need or without insurance is a public responsibility and not an overhead cost. However, tax-conscious voters have limited the ability of governments to spend more for health. An additional and sometimes overlooked possibility for dealing with uncompensated care is the responses that local communities can make. A community services budget framework that includes the inputs of volunteers makes large-scale and sophisticated responses possible through forms of collective organization outside the usual public programs. This framework, applied to one community, illustrates the responses that are possible and the policy questions that must be addressed to expand the options for dealing with the challenge of uncompensated medical care."
69	1992	NVSQ	21:04	Merger and Acquisition Activity Between Nonprofit Social Service Organizations: A Case Study	"This article reports a case study of the process of mergering two nonprofit social service organizations. Although the event was depicted as a merger by the majority of stakeholders, it was in fact an acquisition or buyout of one organization. Although the negotiation processes were described in the language of efficiency, power issues were their focus. Awareness of power differentials and insight into outcome expectations provided leverage to the acquired group. Judicious use of ambiguity aided participants in reaching accord in the negotiations."
70	1992	NVSQ	21:04	Effectiveness of Nongovernmental and Nonprofit Organizations: Some Methodological Caveats	This article provides some caveats to the Boolean algebra procedure described by Robert Herman in the Fall 1990 issue of this journal. Several issues and doubts are raised concerning the use of this procedure as a bridge between log-linear regression and combinational logic. The description of a method that the authors believe to be more appropriate for the study of organizational effectiveness follows. The authors agree with Herman that more studies of the organizational effectiveness of nongovernmental and nonprofit organizations are needed.
71	1992	NVSQ	21:04	Survival of the Nonprofit Spirit in a For-Profit World	"The author contends that nonprofit organizations can find more appropriate administrative values in the traditions of the voluntary sector itself than in the competition-based management approach inherent in private sector administrative theory and practice. He argues that administration in the voluntary sector should be mission based and mission driven, be grounded in the historical traditions of altruism, compassion, and philanthropy, remain sensitive to the key value of volunteerism and to the phenomenon of the volunteers them selves , continue to act as mediating structures between the individual, the community, and the public and private organizations of modern society, emphasize cooperation and collaboration over conflict and competition in the administration of sector organizations, and develop and practice a type of leadership compatible with the values and differences inherent in the independent sector."
72	1993	NVSQ	22:01	Of Books and the Scholarly Infrastructure	"This article suggests that among the impediments to the institutionalization of nonprofit and voluntary action research is the inability of publishers of scholarly books to effectively market them. The chief obstacle to this effort is the failure of general readership periodicals and scholarly journals to comprehensively review the growing literatures on these subjects. In the hope of taking on this task, Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly solicits the assistance of its readers."
73	1993	NVSQ	22:01	Public Policy and the Performance of Nonprofit Organizations: A General Framework	"This article discusses various attempts by economists to model the behavior and performance of nonprofit organizations, and it provides four desiderata of a model suitable for policy analysis: the legal definitions of nonprofit status must be incorporated into the model, the objective function must emerge from the regulatory and competitive environment, the emergence of competitors (for-profit, nonprofit, and governmental) must be endogenous, and the information structure must be fully specified and self-consistent. The article discusses how to incorporate each of these desiderata into a model."
74	1993	NVSQ	22:01	"Religious People, Religious Congregations, and Volunteerism in Human Services: Is there a Link?"	"The literature on volunteerism is voluminous, yet there is very little that examines the relationship between religious belief or observance and volunteerism. Religious belief may relate to an individual's decision to engage in volunteer activity. Religious observance may lead to organized volunteer activities that have a systemic impact on the community. Yet both are inadequately studied. The purpose of this article is to explore the link between religious beliefs and volunteerism and to shed light on the impact of religious observance on volunteering."
75	1993	NVSQ	22:01	"Public Benefit and Member Benefit Nonprofit, Voluntary Groups"	"The focus of this article is on how public versus member benefit nonprofit organizations differ, based largely on data from survey interviews with leaders of fifty-nine nonprofit organizations. The data show that member benefit groups differ on several measures of activity, in sources of income (dues versus fees and sales), in membership openness, and in use of boards and committees. The distinction between public and member benefit groups is meaningful but does not turn out to be overwhelming in importance."
76	1993	NVSQ	22:01	In Search of the Impact of Staff Mix on Long-Term Care Ombudsman Programs	"Although the Older Americans Act requires all states to implement long-term care ombudsman programs, states vary in the utilization of paid staff and volunteers in program implementation. Aggregate data from multiple secondary sources are analyzed in this article to provide an overall picture of the relationship between staff mix (percentage of staff who are volunteers) and the handling of complaints in both nursing and board-and-care homes throughout the country. Although the validity of the data is dubious, staff mix is positively correlated with the volume of complaints reported by ombudsmen and negatively correlated (but not significantly) with complaint resolution. Possible reasons for these findings are discussed."
77	1993	NVSQ	22:02	Portfolio Theory and Nonprofit Financial Stability	This article models and tests for the factors that influence financial predictability for a nonprofit organization. Financial portfolio theory is used to model a nonprofit organization's optimal combination of revenue streams in order to minimize financial risk. The optimal combination of funding from government and other sources depends on the variance and covariance between the sources of revenue. Data from nonprofit foster care organizations in New York State are used to show that nonprofit organizations that are more dependent on government funding as a source of revenue have more predictable revenues.
78	1993	NVSQ	22:02	National Federations: The Role of Voluntary Organizations in Linking Macro and Micro Orders in Civil Society	"The research described in this article represents a preliminary, qualitative, comparative analysis of voluntary national federations of local community organizations and voluntary national federations of local governmental units in the United States and England. The analysis is based on interviews, archival reports, budgets, and newsletters, and participant observation at meetings. These federations force a rethinking of theories of mass society that rely on overly simplistic distinctions between macro and micro, public and private. The research highlights the complex bridging roles that these voluntary national federations play and their essential position at the intersection of macro and micro, state and community."
79	1993	NVSQ	22:02	African American Traditions of Civic Responsibility	"This article reviews issues and problems in conventional studies of African American traditions of civic responsibility. This area of philanthropic studies is deeply flawed by inadequate conceptions of the American nation state and by racialized political ideologies and stereotypes. The author critiques conventional interpretations of African American civic responsibilities and African American civic cultures and suggests alternative conceptual frameworks and new research areas. The purpose is to raise more questions than answers in a research area that remains seriously underdeveloped because of ideological intrusions, racial stereotyping, and the continued dominance of structural functionalism in attempts by American social scientists to interpret the nature of ethnicity and culture in American society."
80	1993	NVSQ	22:02	Volunteers and Their Communities: A Comparative Analysis of Volunteer Fire Fighters	"This article explores the multifaceted relationship between volunteer fire companies and their communities by examining a broad range of socioeconomic characteristics of volunteer fire fighters and general residents in rural New York State. The two data sets are generated by the author's survey instrument and the U.S. Census of Population and Housing. The personal attributes and their statistical significance are examined empirically, and the implications of this research for particular aspects of the fire fighters relationship to their fellow citizens arc discussed."
81	1993	NVSQ	22:03	Twenty Years of the Journal of Voluntary Action Research/Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly: An Assessment of Past Trends and Future Directions	"This article reports on a content analysis of the articles published in Non profit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly and in its predecessor, the journal of Voluntary Action Research, in their first twenty years of existence. The investigation identifies the substantive areas that have been covered, the institutional affiliations of the authors, the methodological styles of the articles, and the disciplines that have provided the research. Thirty-five percent of the authors have been women, about 1 7 percent of the authors have nonacademic affiliations, and sociology is the discipline represented most heavily, although thirty-five disciplines have provided articles. Social work, political science, public affairs, urban affairs, management, and economics have also been heavily represented."
82	1993	NVSQ	22:03	Sector Blurring and Nonprofit Centers: The Case of the United Kingdom	"Fifteen years have passed since the Centre for Voluntary Organisation was founded in London. In reviewing the history of research on the voluntary sector in the United Kingdom, the author asks whether the progressive blurring of boundaries between the governmental, proprietary, and voluntary sectors means that in the long run the third sector will disappear. He argues that it will not, proposing that the core of the voluntary sector is the associational base out of which organizations grow. In turn, that base has connections to the personal, nonorganizational sector of life. Sector blurring occurs at the boundaries between the sectors, but mixed form organizations generally do not have associational bases."
83	1993	NVSQ	22:04	Decentralization and Equity in Public and Nonprofit Sectors	"This article examines hypotheses relating equity in service provision to decentralization in the nonprofit sector and to the lessons of the nonprofit experience for an increasingly decentralized public sector The findings indicate a relatively minor current role for nonprofits in distributive activities and significant differences in the generosity levels of communities and the targeting of donor support for charitable services, as opposed to amenity and civic services. The analyses also indicate some relative decline in giving levels in the most generous communities. The findings imply that decentralization of distributive programs to states and communities may be an effective strategy for limiting their scope and cutting back on national commitments to distressed population groups and communities."
84	1993	NVSQ	22:04	The Role of Nonprofit Enterprise in 1993: Hansmann Revisited	"Henry Hansmann's The Role of Nonprofit Enterprise (1980) has had a seminal influence on analyses of the law and economics of the nonprofit sector Hansmann argues that the nondistribution constraint makes nonprofits an efficient solution infields characterized by contract failure. This article surveys the literature that has extended, criticized, and tested Hansmann's ideas. We add our own criticisms and extensions, with particular attention to the case of hospitals, where nonprofits tax exemptions have undergone an attack with little regard for Hansmann's theories. We conclude that despite some limitations and qualifications, the idea of contract failure remains central to the assessment of the role of nonprofit organizations and to the design of public policies affecting non-profits."
85	1993	NVSQ	22:04	"Nonprofit Advocacy in Weakly Institutionalized Political Systems: The Case of NGDOs in Lima, Peru"	"Nongovernmental development organizations (NGDOs) in the Third World are considered an important force in strengthening democratic practices. Many Third World countries, however, have political systems characterized by both weak states and weak civil societies, especially in the areas of development and welfare planning. In these cases, NGDOs must attempt both to strengthen civil society via grass-roots empowerment and to ensure the viability of the state as an apparatus capable of processing political demands and claims in a more or less democratic fashion. Based on six in-depth case studies, this article examines how Peruvian NGDOs have responded to this situation in the last ten years."
86	1993	NVSQ	22:04	"Role Conflict, Role Ambiguity, and Role Overload on Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Human Service Organizations"	"Much of the literature on boards of directors of nonprofit organizations is prescriptive, that is, it describes what board members are supposed to do. The research described here looks at how members of thirteen human service boards actually play their roles. The findings indicate that some but not all board members play the role of trustee as it is described in the literature, that some board members combine the role of trustee with other roles (such as worker, expert, or representative), and that some play other roles to the exclusion of the role of trustee. The implications of the findings for organizational functioning, board performance, and accountability are explored."
87	1993	NVSQ	22:04	Response of Community Organizations to the Civil Unrest in Los Angeles	"An analysis of four case studies provides evidence of a unique and short-term increase of resource dependence on community organizations by outside institutions in times of emergency. Outside institutions rely on community organizations as the primary service providers, sometimes temporarily replacing traditional service channels, they also depend on the advantages these organizations offer for the distribution of their own resources. A window of opportunity results for these organizations to advocate on behalf of their clientele, establish their own policies for distribution of resources, and expand and create programs. Policy implications are discussed, as well as the possible changes in these relationships in the long run."
88	1994	NVSQ	23:01	Philanthropic Dimensions of Mutual Benefit Organizations	"This article argues that mutual benefit organizations deserve more attention than they have received from nonprofit sector scholars, because these organizations constitute a large and important part of the American non-profit sector and contain a great deal of charitable, altruistic, or philanthropic behavior The article focuses on mutual benefit organizations philanthropic activities, both within the organizations and as an influence on the development of philanthropy in public benefit, 501 (c) (3)-type nonprofits."
89	1994	NVSQ	23:01	Beyond Sobriety: The Cultural Significance of Alcoholics Anonymous as a Social Movement	"With the noticeable growth of Alcoholics Anonymous since its founding in 1935 has come the tendency to regard the organization as a social movement. This article analyzes Alcoholics Anonymous as a social movement, specifically as a new social movement, and draws upon new social movement theory for the analysis. A particular strand of new social movement theory, the identity-oriented paradigm, is applied. The analysis reveals that Alcoholics Anonymous shares several key features with new social movements. Alcoholics Anonymous can be seen as a partial social movement, or a movement network submerged in civil society. Although hidden, it serves as a distinct social and cultural force because of what it offers in addition to abstinence: an alternate interpretation of reality to that of the utilitarian/rationalist perspective, which has traditionally dominated American thought."
90	1994	NVSQ	23:01	Tax and Government Policy Implications for Corporate Foundation Giving	"Even though there were over four million firms in 1988, only 1,300firms had foundations. However, these foundations contributed nearly $1.3 billion to charities. This article examines the effects of tax and other government policies on the establishment and use of corporate foundations in the United States from the early 1900s until the late 1980s. In addition, the study looks at the effect of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 on corporate and foundation giving. Two hypotheses are tested. First, corporate foundations may allow firms to smooth corporate gifts and maintain a steady level of corporate goodwill. The notion of goodwill is similar to firm image or reputation. Second, corporate foundations may allow firms to minimize their tax bills, or maximize profits, over time. The findings of this paper support both hypotheses under the assumption that firms are profit maximizers. Tax and government policy makers can affect the timing and amount of corporate charitable donations by changing the corporate marginal tax rate, the social perceptions of corporate charitable activities (including foundations), the rulings on tax liability for foundations, and laws on deductibility of corporate and foundation gifts."
91	1994	NVSQ	23:02	Church-Agency Relationships in the Black Community	"This article examines referral exchange relationships between black churches and local community health agencies by examining whether organizational and clergy characteristics influence clergy in black churches to refer parishioners to, and receive referrals from, community mental health agencies. We are interested in identifying the typical characteristics of churches and their clergy that tend to participate in these exchanges. The most significant indicators in predicting the probability of church referrals are the extent of interorganizational links and the size of a church. The data do not, however, suggest a reflective relationship, organizational factors do not significantly predict whether a church receives client referrals from community Agencies. We speculate that the lack of reciprocity in this pattern may be caused by a conflict in the levels of rationality within community agencies."
92	1994	NVSQ	23:02	Stewardship Revisited: Secular and Sacred Views of Governance and Management	This article explores a concept central to much of the literature about trustees and managers of nonprofit organizations-stewardship. The concept's sacred origins show it to mean Jar more than just economic prudence. An exegesis of the biblical roots of stewardship shows how understanding of the tasks of contemporary trustees and managers in secular nonprofit organizations can be enriched and broadened.
93	1994	NVSQ	23:02	Organizational Change in Theological Schools: Dilemmas of Ideology and Resources	"Schools of theological education face a series of organizational dilemmas, arising both from their institutional contexts and their multiple constituencies and missions. This article explores these dilemmas and some of the ways in which theological schools have attempted to meet them."
94	1994	NVSQ	23:02	Housing and the Church	"Church involvement in urban community renewal is both widespread and under-recognized. Community development corporations (CDCs), the basic institutional unit involved in urban community renewal, have grown tenfold in number since their creation in the 1960s. Today, many churches are forming CDCs to improve the lives of congregants and residents in the community. This article examines eight church birthed CDCs that are actively engaged in the development of housing for low-and moderate-income individuals and families in Los Angeles County, California."
95	1994	NVSQ	23:02	A Longitudinal Case Study of Religious Congregations in Local Human Services	"Although the involvement of religious organizations in social service provision is increasingly widespread, it has been neglected by scholars. Along with providing important services to the community, involvement with social services is an important step in the development of a public presence for many congregations. This article documents the changing involvement of several mainline Greensboro, North Carolina, churches as they respond to current political events by assuming a collective public profile on community issues. In the terms developed by Roozen, McKinney, and Carroll (1984), they move from a civic mission orientation to a more activist mission orientation."
96	1994	NVSQ	23:03	On the Development of Philanthropic Institutions in Ancient Judaism: Provisions for Poor Travelers	"Philanthropic institutions were not invented in the nineteenth century but were already known in antiquity. Most ancient people displayed sentiments of love or pity for the unfortunate and expressed those feelings in organized ways, though different cultures followed various methods. Invariably, these concerns for others were at first on a person-to-person basis, but in time voluntary organizations arose to provide such services. At a still later date, community agencies began to supplement or replace these voluntary efforts. The chronology of this evolution usually remained imprecise, even elusive, but such a process did occur almost everywhere. The development of services for poor travelers permits a test of the general hypothesis that philanthropic institutions evolved from individual concern, that the initiation of voluntary organizations followed, and that an acceptance of communal responsibility for the welfare of various dependent groups came still later. The evolution of services for migrants and other poor travelers in Judea is traced during a thousand-year period from circa 800 B.C.E. to 200 C.E."
97	1994	NVSQ	23:03	Catholic Elementary Schools in Chicago's Black Inner City: Four Modes of Adaptation to Environmental Change	"This article summarizes qualitative research on Catholic elementary schools in Chicago's black inner city. It describes jour categories of schools that emerged as a result of in-depth interviews with pastors and principals of thirty-three schools. These categories represent the basic approaches schools used as they attempted to adapt to radical changes in their populations and environments. The paper analyzes the factors influencing approaches to adaptation and examines the organizational effectiveness of each mode. Using an organizational framework, the author explores the relationship between resource dependency, autonomy, and institutional legitimacy."
98	1994	NVSQ	23:03	Philanthropy in a Different Voice: The Women's Funds	"Benevolent work has proven especially attractive for women. An outgrowth of this tradition, and the focus of this paper, is the recent development of the women's funds philanthropic organizations that were created to empower women and girls. These new organizations represent a change in the role that women have played in philanthropy. Moreover, the structure of these funds provides insights into the role of gender in organizational analysis. The women's funds represent gendered bureaucracies in which the interests of philanthropic women mitigate the tendency toward bureaucratization."
99	1994	NVSQ	23:03	Determinants of Voluntary Association Participation and Volunteering: A Literature Review	"This article reviews the American literature in social science for the period 1975 1992 on the determinants of volunteer participation in programs and associations. It finds that most studies are too narrow in the hinds of variables that they include and that explanatory power is reduced as a result. Such participation is significantly greater for certain hinds of variables: contextual (for example, smaller community), social background (for example, higher education), personality (for example, more efficacy/internal locus of control), and attitude (for example, more group attractiveness) as well as situational variables (for example, being asked to join). Very few studies combine measures of each type of variable. When several predictor realms arc included, much higher variance is accounted for. Other social participation (political, mass media, recreational, and so on) is associated with volunteer participation. This association confirms a general activity model that posits a clustering of different types of socioculturally approved discretionary activity."
100	1994	NVSQ	23:03	Promoting Volunteerism: An Empirical Examination of the Appeal of Persuasive Messages	"Two studies examined the persuasive appeal of messages that promote involvement in volunteer work. Four messages were created by combining two different strategies of argument (one providing reasons for volunteering, the other countering reasons for not volunteering) and two different forms of reasons for volunteering or not volunteering (abstract, value-based reasons versus concrete, specific reasons). In both studies, college students with and without current volunteer experience judged the counter-abstract-reasons-for-not-volunteering and provide-concrete-reasons-for-volunteering messages to be the most persuasive. However, the effectiveness of a message also depended on the goal of the appeal (that is, recruitment of new volunteers or retention of current volunteers). The implications of these findings for campaigns designed to promote volunteerism are discussed."
101	1994	NVSQ	23:04	Emergent Organization as a Practical Strategy: Executing Trustee Functions in Alcoholics Anonymous	"Trusteeship functions in nonprofit organizations are most often analyzed by drawing on ideas from the world of proprietary firms and organizational theories that have their roots in the theory of bureaucracy. Recent theories of nonprofit organizations have explored alternative organizational visions, emphasizing that nonprofits often are embedded in larger communities and that their organizational styles are embedded in distinctive cultures of voluntarism. Such perspectives, however, suffer because they tell us little about how to understand notions such as accountability and trusteeship. This article, a case study of Alcoholics Anonymous, offers a theory of how accountability and trusteeship functions may be effectively performed in an organization that is guided by a distinctive culture and idiosyncratic organizational practices that differ sharply from the bureaucratic, corporate model of organization."
102	1994	NVSQ	23:04	Semiformal Organizational Structure Among Social Movement Organizations: An Analysis of the U.S. Peace Movement	"After twenty years of resource mobilization theory, the lack of systematic, empirical analyses of organizational diversity within and across social movement organizations (SMOs) remains an ironic weakness in the research literature. Survey data from a stratified, nationally representative sample of U.S. groups working for peace enables the demographic diversity, internal operations, and external relations of peace movement organizations (PMOs) to be described. Furthermore, a reliable scale of semiformal organizational structure capable of capturing empirically the range of SMO forms from named groups with a completely informal structure to a threshold of minimally formal structure is developed. Multiple regression analysis examines the relations between semiformal structures and aspects of PMO demographics, internal operations, and external relations. Formal structure among PMOs was found to be associated with surpassing threshold levels of budgetary size and, beneath that rather low $30,000 per year threshold, with increasing budgetary size. Participation pressures as indicated by increased membership, staff size, and voluntarism failed to predict the presence of formal structure. Results are consistent with SMO adoption of culturally legitimate organizational templates and with state efforts to manage citizen protest through the tax code."
103	1994	NVSQ	23:04	Mapping Volunteer Activity	"The interest and recognition of the importance of volunteers over the last two decades has only highlighted confusion surrounding use of the term volunteer. Quite often in accounts of volunteer activity, terms are used interchangeably, although their content may vary. This article aims at analytically clarifying many of the complexities embedded in volunteer activity. In this endeavor, we use a mapping sentence method, which groups a variety of volunteer characteristics under key interrelated facets. We use a variety of literature-based components of volunteerism and systematically group them into ten facets. Together, they provide clarity and better understanding of the major components of volunteer activity."
104	1994	NVSQ	23:04	Organized Labor and Philanthropic Foundations: Partners or Strangers?	"Although labor unions have been among the most important categories of voluntary organizations in American society, little has been written about them in the nonprofits literature. This article examines the relationship between foundations and labor unions. That relationship has involved both approach and avoidance. Tied as they have been to corporate leaders, foundations often have opposed radicalism in the labor movement. However, foundations also have supported the union movement in a variety of ways. Particularly important is their support for research, education, and community reconstruction in the wake of plant closings."

Using Indianapolis as a model, this study demonstrates that musical performances raised money for needy people and worthwhile causes, but served an equally important function in helping to build a cohesive community, with both a national patriotism and a local civic pride. Music was a participatory activity, its performers and audiences drawn from the entire community without distinctions of class, wealth, or education. For its performers in particular, organized as they were in voluntary associations, music provided practical training in democracy. Evoking the philanthropic exertions of both musicians and patrons, capable of exercising a decisive moral influence over its listeners, music was explicitly understood to be an indispensable source of positive values."

107	1995	NVSQ	24:01:00	Novel Funding for a Novel Nonprofit Sector: Latin America's Private Research Centers	"Latin America's nonprofit research centers have a major impact on politics and society as well as on academia. Crucial to this impact is the central nonprofit challenge of attracting sufficient, stable income. The centers have done a remarkable job of building a novel and increasingly diversified income profile. This profile ruptures the region's statist tradition as it rests on voluntary giving, markets, an evolving private-public mix, and pluralism."
108	1995	NVSQ	24:01:00	Volunteering and Charitable Giving: Do Religious and Associational Ties Promote Helping Behavior?	"Most research on helping behavior has concentrated on situational and personality effects on the decision to provide emergency aid, less work has dealt with social determinants of common, nonemergency helping. We investigated the effects of religious and associational ties on secular volunteering and charitable giving in a sample of 800 Indiana residents. We found that belonging to a range of voluntary associations increases volunteering and giving. Participation in church groups also increases both forms of secular helping, but attending church does not."
109	1995	NVSQ	24:01:00	Do the Poor Pay More: Is the U-Shaped Curve Correct?	"We first show where the U-shaped curve of the relationship between income and charitable giving, which is often construed as evidence that the poor pay more than do the wealthy, comes from. We then recalculate the relationship between income and giving, showing why the data do not support the contention that the poor contribute a greater percentage of their income to philanthropy."
110	1995	NVSQ	24:02:00	Latent Cosmopolitan and Local Orientation Among Rural Emergency Service Volunteers	"In rural regions, trained volunteer firefighters and medics provide emergency services, often with considerable personal risk and without financial reward. However, these Volunteers exhibit two different latent orientations: firefighters are more localistic in their outlook than medical volunteers. These latent orientations reflect the structural characteristics of the two emergency service agencies. These orientations are empirically demonstrated to persist in the volunteering and personal attributes of the volunteers themselves. Survey data are incorporated into a probit model to indicate the relative influence of orientational factors on where the volunteers offer their emergency services."
111	1995	NVSQ	24:02:00	The Privilege of Privacy: Twenty-Five Years in the Public-Accountability Record of Foundations	"The public accountability record of foundations is inadequate, despite efforts by Congress, philanthropic associations, and members of the foundation community to improve it. This article traces the public accountability record of foundations to 1936 but focuses on the twenty-five years since the Tax Reform Act of 1969, which has two provisions on the public accountability of foundations. The findings of studies are presented as well as the testimony of people inside and outside foundations. The article concludes with eight recommendations to improve the public accountability of foundations."
112	1995	NVSQ	24:02:00	Managerial Roles and Entrepreneurship in Nonprofit Urban Arts Agencies in Virginia	The purpose of this study was to determine how arts administrators in virginia manage under conditions of retrenchment and fiscal constraint. The data analysis separated managers into four role groups according to their perceived degree of creativity and documented access to organizational resources. Managerial role types were compared with management behaviors to discern significant differences. The data suggest that arts agencies must select managers with a combination of entrepreneurial and administrative skills.
113	1995	NVSQ	24:03:00	"Nonprofit Organizations Facing State Incitement Strategies, Policies Related to Alcohol Problems and HIV/AIDS in Switzerland"	"This article deals with Swiss state agencies in the fields of HIV/AIDS and alcohol-related problems. We are interested in their development over the lust decade: What types of societal regulations did the state establish during the eighties and what are their effects? Why were they enacted? Developments in these fields can be seen as a transformation of the relation between the state and civil society. As a liberal state holding the principle of subsidiarity as a major tool, the Swiss state first became a limited welfare state, then a provoker state trying to stimulate autonomous societal organization."
114	1995	NVSQ	24:03:00	Factors Affecting Volunteer Long-Term Care Ombudsman Organizational Commitment and Burnout	"This article examines volunteer nursing home advocates perceptions about their work and organizational experiences. Bivariate correlations and regression analysis support a model of volunteer organizational effectiveness incorporating selected job context variables. The most important results concern organizational commitment, job involvement, role conflict, role ambiguity, and burnout. An especially important finding was the relation between higher job involvement and lower role confusion, higher organizational commitment, and a higher sense of personal accomplishment. The researchers were surprised by exceedingly low burnout scores and by burnout's modest link to organizational commitment. Demographic findings were mixed with several hypothesized associations proving nonsignificant or inconsistent with previous research."
115	1995	NVSQ	24:03:00	The Ironies of Human Resource Mobilization by Neighborhood Associations	"This article explores the mobilization of human resources by sixty-one neighborhood associations in the Seattle area. Although support is generated for hypotheses that emphasize the importance of neighborhood composition, internal polity, association incentive systems, and communications channels, ironies of human resource mobilization are discovered and explained. Specifically, both newsletters and the value of residential property promote membership and discourage participation. The negative effect of newsletters is particularly evident for representative democracies in wealthy areas."
116	1995	NVSQ	24:03:00	Leadership in Hard Times: Are Nonprofits Well-Served?	"Resource shortages have stimulated a change in focus among leaders of social service agencies, moving them away from a mission and toward a professional orientation more concerned with self-preservation. This is manifested both in a greater concern about resource mobilization than mission and professional issues and in an inward orientation among administrators rather than an orientation to the environment. This represents a dramatic change since the 1970s, when organizational theory first came to recognize the environment us an important factor in organizational behavior, and when successful organizational strategy was understood to require moving beyond organizational boundaries. This article reports on a national survey of executive directors and board presidents of family service agencies in major cities. It shows substantial consensus between these two groups that resource issues are more important than mission and professional issues, and that solving resource problems involves strategies that emphasize organizational autonomy."
117	1995	NVSQ	24:04:00	Philanthropy and Injustice in Mill and Addams	"The idea that philanthropy has promoted social justice is historically well-established. Voluntary action, however, can also be used to perpetuate injustice. In this article I analyze criticisms of philanthropy given by John Stuart Mill and Jane Addams, two individuals who appreciated the value of philanthropic effort but were clearly aware of its potential to perpetuate injustice. Mill argues that injustice in philanthropy results when introduced from other areas of life (political and legal structures or common cultural assumptions, for example) and when philanthropists use poor judgment, Addams criticizes the principle of voluntarism itself."
118	1995	NVSQ	24:04:00	Reputation as Collateral: An Economic Analysis of the Role of Trustees of Nonprofits	"The role of the board of trustees of nonprofits (NPs) is to legitimize the nonprofit by signaling to consumers that the nonprofit can be trusted and is able to supply the services it offers. Therefore, nonprofits invite people with appropriate attributes such as reputation and wealth to endorse the organization by lending their names to it. Such people provide their reputations to NPs as collateral. It is the exposure of trustees to the potential loss of this collateral that enhances consumer and donor trust in NPs. This article expands these ideas and yields several results on the attributes of desirable and willing trustees."
119	1995	NVSQ	24:04:00	Financing Philanthropic Institutions in Biblical and Talmudic Times	"In ancient Judea, support for the poor was the responsibility of individuals. The Bible commanded each Jewish farmer to set aside a small part of his harvest for the poor This arrangement reflected life in a simple agricultural society. When social, political, and economic conditions changed and poverty became a growing social problem. these arrangements were no longer adequate and others evolved in their place. The evolution of these new programs, us well as various innovative funding methods developed in the Second Temple and talmudic periods to support them, are reviewed."
120	1995	NVSQ	24:04:00	The Economic Structure of the Charitable Sector in the United Kingdom	This article reports the findings of a major research study of the income and expenditure of charitable organizations in the United Kingdom. It situates them within the existing literature on this topic and highlights key themes and conclusions.
121	1995	NVSQ	24:04:00	Teenage Volunteers and Their Values	"This article analyzes national survey data sponsored by the independent SECTOR and collected by the Gallup organization in 1991. The survey shows that values that favor charity and eschew material goals encourage volunteering, and also that youth from higher social classes are more likely to volunteer than those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Participation in religious activities and spiritual values are not related to the likelihood of volunteering. Although these findings help us to understand who volunteers, they also suggest strategies volunteer organizers may use to attract volunteers from underrepresented groups."
122	1996	NVSQ	25:01:00	"Philanthropy, Nonprofits, and the Fiscal Health of Cities"	"A nonprofit sector that is quite active in the financing or production of public and human services could reduce the financial burdens on local governments to provide services. These governments could be considered more fiscally healthy than governments in communities with less active nonprofit sectors. Although an active nonprofit sector would seem to significantly affect a city's fiscal health, little statistical evidence exists to support this impression. Research reported here indicates that a measure of nonprofit sector service activity, along with accepted measures of fiscal health, effectively describes the distribution of bond ratings for the population of large U.S. city governments. Evidence is provided that (a) municipal bond ratings as of 1990 were an effective measure of fiscal health for large cities, and (b) nonprofit sector service activity was one of the most important determinants."
123	1996	NVSQ	25:01:00	Internal Revenue Service 990 Data: Fact or Fiction?	"This exploratory study examines the reliability and validity of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 990 data, an increasingly prevalent source of financial measures in the research of nonprofit organizations today. Correlations between selected financial measures taken from the IRS returns of 270 nonprofits and the identical measures gathered from the same organizations via mail questionnaire are examined, followed by examination of financial statements and interviews with participants in the accounting process from a subsample of the organizations. High correlations show the IRS 990 Returns to be a generally reliable source of financial data, although this varies by entry, organizational size, and NTEE category. The validity of this data, however, is questionable. The growing prevalence of expense shifting combined with a lack of rules, guidelines, and monitoring of internal expense allocations allows for increasing distortions in the financial picture portrayed by the IRS 990 Return."
124	1996	NVSQ	25:01:00	Big Fights: Competition between Poor People's Social Movement Organizations	"Using a national survey and interviews with organizers, the authors find two broad areas of competition between social movement organizations (SMOs). Territorial competition focuses on turf and resources. Organizational competition comprises recruitment of staff leadership styles, definition of issues, training strategies, and recruitment of members. In this study of poor people's SMOs, the authors find that competition differs between SMOs in national federations and those that are independent, local groups. Further, they find that competition, rather than cooperation, is the prevailing pressure on SMOs."
125	1996	NVSQ	25:01:00	"Oligarchy and Adaptation to Mass Society in an All-Volunteer Organization: Implications for Understanding Leadership, Participation, and Change"	"Using a case study of an all-volunteer fire department, internal structural changes and adaptation to external forces in a small, voluntary, democratic organization are examined. The article seeks to make two points from this examination. First, forces of mass society that were moving the organization away from its traditional community focus were mediated by an oligarchy of professionalized leaders. Second, the concept of oligarchy is useful in understanding leadership, membership participation, and change in all-volunteer organizations."
126	1996	NVSQ	25:01:00	"Workplace Attitudes, Experiences, and Job Satisfaction of Social Work Administrators in Nonprofit and Public Agencies: 1981 and 1989"	"This article profiles workplace attitudes, experiences, and job satisfaction of social work administrators employed in nonprofit and public agencies during the dramatic social service changes of the 1980s. Secondary analysis of national, cross-sectional surveys of National Association of Social Work members in 1981 and 1989 reveal changes over time and by nonprofit versus public agency auspices regarding sense of professional competencies, working conditions, job stressors, and sense of professional support. Job satisfaction of managers in both sectors is significantly predicted in a multiple regression by a sense of challenge, promotion opportunities, and lack of value conflict in the work they do. The findings also reveal greater concrete rewards but declining promotion opportunities among the nonprofit administrators and a greater sense of challenge but declining income among public agency administrators. The findings suggest several directions for social work education and management training."
127	1996	NVSQ	25:01:00	Mission Accomplishment as Philanthropic Organization Effectiveness: Key Findings from the Excellence in Philanthropy Project	"Philanthropic organizations make a significant impact on the lives of Americans, and the effectiveness of these organizations is of great interest. The Excellence in Philanthropy Project is intended to contribute to the development of theory for designing philanthropic organizations for producing increased levels of effectiveness. The findings reviewed here are based on questionnaires collected from 101 philanthropic organizations in Franklin County (Columbus), Ohio. This article reports on the ways mission statements are expressed-as an intention to affect the world outside the organization, the organization itself, or both-and also on whether organizations 'performance measures assess mission accomplishment."
128	1996	NVSQ	25:02:00	Another Role for Nonprofits: The Case of Mop-Ups and Nursemaids Resulting from Privatization in Emerging Economies	"This article synthesizes economic, sociological, and historical theory, first in the American context and then in an Eastern European (Polish) context, to develop an explanation for a distinctive type of nonprofit activity. The authors explore a role for some nonprofits arising due to the privatization experience in the early history of the United States and to recent privatization in Poland (as an example of a transitioning economy), where nonprofits develop as facilitators for the creation of for-profit enterprises. The facilitator hypothesis proposes two roles for nonprofits. First, they mop up problems created when firms are privatized, assisting those persons left unemployed or otherwise adversely affected by privatization. Second, they act as nursemaids, nurturing nascent for-profit businesses and industries. This article suggests further study of emergent organizational forms in the transformation from command to market-oriented economies as a way to understand the diffusion of sectoral models from one economy to another."
129	1996	NVSQ	25:02:00	Second-Order Cultural Effects of Civil Rights on Southern Nonprofit Organizations: The Atlanta YMCAs	"Mayer Zald identified the mechanisms of adjustment that allowed the Chicago Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) to adapt to a changing environment. Changes in the YMCA in Atlanta, Georgia, that accompanied a division into an integrated organization for middle class residents and an inner city Black organization also reveal accommodation to environmental flux. However, in this case, the changes were due to the anachronistic persistence of segregation in the South, the strengths of southern, historically Black institutions and traditions, and the transformation of cultural understandings that accompanied the civil rights movement. Years of acrimony, alternating with stalemate, led to a solution that permitted the survival of both organizations. It is in the cultural environment of the South that similar arrangements develop between historically Black colleges and predominantly White colleges and universities. During the 1990s, by law (and often by circumstances of geography), historically Black institutions include Whites but are recognized as uniquely serving Black constituents."
130	1996	NVSQ	25:02:00	Philanthropic Styles in the United States: Toward a Theory of Regional Differences	Our understanding of American philanthropy lacks a well-developed regional dimension despite the prevalence of regionalism in so much of American history and life. The value in exploring regional patterns in giving and volunteering among Americans lies in its practical application for the management and development of nonprofit organizations. A review of the rich literature on American regionalism yields at least one model-Daniel Elazar's delineation of political cultures-that investigators might employ to uncover regional variations in the ways in which Americans approach and practice philanthropy. Distinctive philanthropic cultures are hypothesized based on Elazar's paradigm and are offered as a regional overlay on current mappings of place-to-place differences.
131	1996	NVSQ	25:02:00	Volunteering: A Serious Leisure Perspective	"A handful of observers have suggested that volunteering can be defined and described as a leisure activity. Extending this reasoning, it is argued that many kinds of volunteering, because they foster the acquisition and expression of a combination of special skills, knowledge, and experience, can be looked on as serious leisure. The serious leisure perspective not only defines and explains volunteers and volunteering as self-interested leisure but also opens the way to a more comprehensive theoretical statement of leisure volunteering than was heretofore available. In this article, the author explores the leisure components of all volunteering to learn where the serious leisure model applies. Distinctions are drawn between types of volunteering: career and casual, formal and informal, and occupational and nonoccupational. The perspective fails to fit each type equally well. It fits best the types of volunteering classifiable as formal and nonoccupational, types in which volunteers normally find substantial leisure careers."
132	1996	NVSQ	25:02:00	Can Campaigning be Evaluated?	"Nonprofit organizations, their consultants, and researchers have well-developed ideas about how to evaluate service provision. Yet researchers seem to know much less about how to evaluate their policy campaigning. Perhaps this is not surprising. Because typical campaigning situations are complex, and because consumer constituencies are hard to identify and may typically be in mutual conflict, the relationship between activity and impact in campaign management is uncertain. This article develops an approach to the problem by concentrating on the evaluation of strategy rather than of impact directly. It combines policy analysis, norm and convention analysis, and economic analysis of efficiency. The central innovation, however, is to apply game theory to appraise the effectiveness of campaign strategies. A worked example of the approach is given."
133	1996	NVSQ	25:03:00	"Mending the Social Safety Net after State Socialism: Dobrobit- One Nongovernmental Organization in Zagreb, Croatia"	"The breakdown of structural arrangements in the former state socialist countries of Eastern Europe means that the rules of the game are being renegotiated. Intermediating institutions are now emerging as actors in this process. Based on a series of interviews with key members of one young nongovernmental organization in Croatia, this study seeks to test the validity of particular Western theories to explain whether such organizations foster policy entrepreneurship. Analysis suggests that both contextual and structural factors have an impact on nascent third sector infrastructure development in ways that delimit entrepreneurial resources."
134	1996	NVSQ	25:03:00	Female Participation in Public Interest Nonprofit Governance: Yet Another Glass Ceiling?	"Women are disproportionately represented in staffing of nonprofit organizations yet are found much less frequently in positions of organizational governance: executive directorships and board memberships. Using data collected from more than 200 public interest nonprofit organizations and from semistructured personal interviews with public interest nonprofit board members, this empirical analysis provides insights into the organizational biases and candidate attributes that inhibit women in their efforts at attaining governing positions in the nonprofit sector."
135	1996	NVSQ	25:03:00	The Role of Crises and Opportunities in Organizational Change: A Look at a Nonprofit Religious College	"This study examines the role of crises and opportunities in the 40-year organizational change history of a not-for-profit religious college. Findings suggest that crisis intensity (a) increases organizational members commitment to the status quo and decreases their support for change, (b) triggers change attempts, and (c) may increase the likelihood that changes are implemented. Heightened opportunity levels (a) increase members receptivity to change and decrease their support for the status quo but (b) do not increase the number of changes being attempted or (c) the likelihood that change is implemented."
136	1996	NVSQ	25:03:00	Rationality and Politics: What Really Goes on When Funders Evaluate the Performance of Fundees?	This article provides an in-depth case study of the process by which a funder evaluates the performance of a client nonprofit agency in the social services sector. The connection between the evaluation and the subsequent funding decision is also explored. A framework for uncovering the basic dimensions of the evaluation process is presented and applied to the evaluator-evaluatee relationship studied. Various points at which perceptions of the relationship got distorted are identified. The evaluation process was found to be a subtle and complex interaction of formally rational methods and nonformal subjective judgments. The implications of these findings for practical improvements to the evaluation process are discussed.
137	1996	NVSQ	25:03:00	"Ram A. Cnaan, Femida Handy, and Margaret Wadsworth"	"The term volunteer is used too broadly in denoting nonsalaried service. In this article, the authors attempt to delineate the boundaries of the term volunteer. They first reviewed 11 widely used definitions of volunteer. Using a content analysis, they identified four key dimensions commonly found in most definitions of volunteer. They then proposed an internal continuum (Guttman scale) for each dimension that distinguished between pure and broadly defined volunteers. They analyzed the importance of these dimensions in determining how people perceive what makes a volunteer. They expanded this analysis by introducing and exemplifying the concept of the net cost of volunteering. They developed a 21-item instrument and asked 514 respondents to assess the extent to which each item represented their perceptions of a volunteer. Their findings support the dimensions and their continuum as well as the importance of net cost as a basis for public perceptions of what makes a volunteer."
138	1996	NVSQ	25:04:00	Voluntary Action in a Scandinavian Welfare Context: The Case of Sweden	"The purpose of this article is to present some characteristics of the Swedish voluntary sector. With the help of recent research results, the voluntary sector and its wide range of activities is placed into a comprehensive structure that includes historical and cultural roots as well as the connection between the sector and the emergence of the Swedish welfare state. What is characteristic for the Swedish welfare model also explains, in important respects, the conditions of the voluntary sector and the way in which it finds articulation. However, this is not in itself a sufficient explanation if we are to understand the many-sided phenomenon represented by the Swedish voluntary sector. The role played by the tradition of popular mass movements in shaping the voluntary sector of today must also be taken into account. After a general overview in the first half of the article, two aspects of Swedish voluntary sector activities are presented to illustrate these points: the high level of volunteerism of the population and the particular character and role of voluntary organizations in the field of social care."
139	1996	NVSQ	25:04:00	The United Way System at the Crossroads: Community Planning and Allocation	"United Way (UW) organizations have long portrayed themselves as performing three core functions for local communities: fund-raising, community planning, and fund-allocation. Contradictory forces increasingly threaten the ability of UW organizations to perform all of these core functions. Some remain hidden and unacknowledged for some period of time. Many UW systems face the same challenges: how to raise funds, address needs, and respond to diverse constituencies, how to manage conflicts with adjacent United Ways, and how to create and maintain internal consensus to address these challenges effectively. These are important questions for understanding how organizations relate to their environment and for understanding U.S. society. The scope of United Way systems is impressive and plays a key role both in shaping community perceptions of problems and as a major avenue through which the corporate sector takes an active role in local communities."
140	1996	NVSQ	25:04:00	The Behavior of Foundations in an Organizational Frame: A Case Study	"Until relatively recently, there has been little serious historical scholarship or organizational analysis concerning foundations. This article examines the experience of the Ford Foundation in creating and implementing a large new grant-making initiative applying three models of organizational behavior: the rational actor model, a bureaucratic politics model, and an organizational process model. The article provides a preliminary analysis of the strength of these models for illuminating the way foundations operate and shape their grant-making programs. Large foundations are complex institutions whose decisions may not always be optimal on some public interest or cost-benefit calculus. At a time when public affairs professionals find themselves turning to private foundations for solutions, an understanding of internal dynamics may help in building public-private partnerships on a realistic footing."
141	1996	NVSQ	25:04:00	Modem Economic Theory and the Study of Nonprofit Organizations: Why the Twain Shall Meet	"Established economic theories of nonprofit organizations are incomplete. They tend to treat nonprofits as a black box, in other words, they do not address the severe incentive problems that can and do arise within nonprofit organizations and that undermine the main building block of traditional theories of nonprofits-the nondistribution constraint. Modern economic theory can help to unpack the black box. It also suggests research questions and policy prescriptions quite different from those advocated by established economic theories of nonprofit organizations. The author argues that game theory, by virtue of its emphasis on strategic interaction and asymmetric information, and its ability to conceptualize organizational culture and integrity, provides a unifying framework for understanding the insights of modern economic theory. The author also argues that game theory is ideally suited to help practitioners understand incentive problems."
142	1996	NVSQ	25:04:00	Volunteers Motivations: Findings from a National Survey	"The present investigation used responses to Independent Sector's 1992 national survey of giving and volunteering in the United States to address several questions about the motivations of volunteers. Drawing on the functional approach to volunteers motivations, and its operationalization in the Volunteer Functions Inventory (VFI), relations between motivations and various aspects of volunteer behavior were examined, along with associations of motivations and demographic variables. Analyses revealed that current volunteers and nonvolunteers differed on motivations, people with different volunteering histories revealed different motivational patterns, unique combinations of motivations were associated with different types of volunteering activities, and motivational differences were associated with different demographic groups. The implications of these findings for understanding the nature and function of the motivations to volunteer, and the applications to the practice of volunteerism, are discussed."
143	1996	NVSQ	25:04:00	Service Learning and Commitment to Community: Exploring the Implications of Honors Students Perceptions of the Process 2 Years Later	"This article discusses an investigation involving 13 students who enrolled in a senior honors seminar designed as a service-learning course. The purpose was to explore how the participants perceived the course and their role in the community 2 years later. In keeping with the grounded theory techniques used to analyze the data, the study focused on discovering a grounded substantive theory (Glaser & Strauss, 1967) that described the processes involved in service learning for this particular group rather than on measuring outcomes. Using this approach led to the realization that there is a discrepancy between how many educators and researchers have conceptualized service and how participants in this study perceive their commitment to community 2 years after completing a service-learning course. Elements related to this new orientation that merit further exploration include the types and extent of commitment to community, participants perceptions of the social context for their commitment to community, and variables other than the service-learning experience, such as background, fit, and current life circumstances that may influence the way service learning affects participants commitment to community. These elements may have consequences for service-learning design, evaluation, and further research."
144	1996	NVSQ	25:04:00	The Effect of State Intervention in the Nonprofit Sector: The Case of the New Deal	"This article raises the question of how the influx of federal money during the New Deal affected nonprofit organizations (NPOs) operating in the social welfare sector. Using data on the number of NPOs operating in six service categories in New York City, we demonstrate three distinct trends some types of organizations fared very poorly, other types remained relatively stable, and a third set actually experienced significant growth in numbers. We hypothesize that two factors explain these variations the extent to which NPOs were perceived to be doing work that was explicitly related to the immediate crisis appears to have influenced their success in sustaining charitable support. More importantly, the extent to which a class of organizations was excluded from participating in federal relief programs appears to have significantly influenced the overall success and failure rates. Those organizations that were included as partners in the federal relief efforts experienced significant growth."
145	1997	NVSQ	26:01:00	"Fostering Community Participation to Influence Public Policy: Lessons from the Woods Fund of Chicago, 1987-1993"	"This article examines how local public policy may be influenced by small foundations. Written as a policy analysis, it focuses on one case study: the work of the Woods Fund of Chicago in the Chicago school reform movement from 1987 to 1993. This is an ongoing reform movement rooted in a path-breaking, 1988 state law that decentralized the governance of Chicago's public schools. Woods played a special role in bolstering the movement's central tenet: parent and community empowerment. Woods alone was not responsible for parent and community control becoming the basis of the new school governance system. But its strategic focus, in both funding and activism, contributed to the idea's ascendance and helped establish the governance structure in which Chicago's biggest foundations have invested so substantially. Three strategic factors explain Woods effect: unwavering means, enduring collaboration, and staff activism. Although centered on one foundation, this article provides insights on two gaps in public policy and philanthropic research: most broadly, the intersection of local foundations and local public affairs, and, more specifically, the ways small foundations may contribute to the formulation and implementation of urban education policy."
146	1997	NVSQ	26:01:00	"Accountability Misplaced: Private Social Welfare Agencies and the Public in Cleveland, 1880-1920"	"Nonprofits are scrambling to account for their fiscal policies, management structure, and the value of their missions. This current crisis of accountability is only the most recent manifestation of a problem that has plagued voluntary organizations for over a century. A historical perspective reveals more about the issue of accountability than tax exemption, the ubiquity of nonprofits, or greed and insensibility among nonprofits and their employees. Four fundamental issues can be identified: the variety of constituencies to which nonprofits are accountable, conflict over the allocation of resources, the matter of exclusivity, and two additional sources of conflict of values. The periodic crises of accountability faced by nonprofits reveal that the conflicts inherent in nonprofits are constantly being negotiated, necessarily leading to a dynamic, ever-shifting system of nonprofit organization and of interorganizational relationships. The nonprofit sector provides an arena in which these conflicts can be negotiated."
147	1997	NVSQ	26:01:00	Local Government Funding for Housing Development in Chicago: A Comparison of Funding for Nonprofit and For-Profit Groups	"This article compares City of Chicago Department of Housing (DOH) funding for nonprofit organizations with the city's funding of for-profit developers, finding that DOH provides more generous funding for for-profit groups through its flagship program. Nonprofits receive more overall money through the other two programs analyzed, though the subsidy differences are more ambiguous than in the flagship program. The study determines that important distinctions exist between the rental products produced by nonprofit and for-profit housing development groups in Chicago. Nonprofits tend to employ DOH funding to reach the lowest income households, whereas for-profits seek moderate-income renters in more stable neighborhoods. These distinctions begin to break down, however, when the funding structure requires all recipients to produce very low rents."
148	1997	NVSQ	26:01:00	Total Cost Differentials in the Nonprofit Sector	"Previous work has looked at wage differentials between the nonprofit and for-profit sectors, without including the cost of fringe benefits in calculating these differentials. This article uses new data to examine the determinants of total compensation in the nonprofit, for-profit, and governance sectors. A significant negative effect from nonprofit status is found."
149	1997	NVSQ	26:01:00	Portfolio Theory and Nonprofit Financial Stability: A Comment and Extension	"The contribution of Kingma (1993) to NPO theory is discussed and enlarged. Portfolio theory in interaction with utility theory is shown to be a very useful instrument to model nonprofit organization (NPO) financing. Furthermore, it is suggested that portfolio theory is partially useful to model the NPO investment decision. Some essential elements of such a theory are presented."
150	1997	NVSQ	26:01:00	Efficiency of Fund-Raising Activities: An Application of Data Envelopment Analysis	"Nonprofit institutions rely heavily on unearned income to fund their activities. This unearned income arrives in the form of donations from the public and business, as well as grants from foundations and governmental agencies. Within any organization, decisions on the efficient allocation of resources are crucial. This is especially true in not-for-profit enterprises for whom the opportunities to earn income are limited and reliance on donations and grants is therefore paramount. In this article, we test the relative efficiency of the developmental spending of 78 symphony orchestras in the United States. The data are from the 1987-1988 American Symphony Orchestra League's Comparative Statistical Reports. We use Data Envelopment Analysis to gauge the relative efficiency of the fund-raising efforts. Orchestras deemed inefficient are given proportional, realizable input reductions that allow production of their current level of donations and grants. Regression analysis is then used to investigate the determinants of efficiency, holding constant orchestra and demographic characteristics."

More general, research-based, statistical overview 'maps of the nonprofit sector (NPS)follow this same 'flat earth approach. The rest of the NPS consists mainly of grassroots associations, which have cumulative magnitudes greater than paid staff nonprofits in America on several dimensions circa 1990-numbers of groups, memberships, members, active volunteers, yearly hours of volunteer time, and full-time equivalents (FTEs) of annual work by associational (not program) volunteers. These figures, combined with better estimates of numbers of IRS-missing paid staff nonprofits, constitute the first comprehensive round earth statistical map of the NPS as presented here. IRS listings and prevailing flat earth statistical maps based on them ignore about 90% of all nonprofits in the nation as well as half of volunteers and their work time. Suggestions are made for improving future NPS map making and research."
152	1997	NVSQ	26:02:00	How Alternative Ideas Become Institutions: The Case of Feminist Collectives	"Using institutional theory developed by organizational sociologists, I tell the story of feminist collectives in the United States. I argue that feminist collectives are a specific case of the emergence, institutionalization, and deinstitutionalization of alternative ideas and structures. I document these three processes using historical material (both academic and political) from the contemporary women's movement and more recent empirical studies of women's organizations. The contribution this analysis makes to organization building and theory building is considered."
153	1997	NVSQ	26:02:00	Women as Volunteers and Activists	"This study used logistic regression analysis on data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Labor Market Experience to identify characteristics associated with the likelihood of female volunteers engaging in activities to change social conditions and with the likelihood of female activists being volunteers. Results suggested that volunteers are more likely to be activists to the extent that they perceive what they do as making a difference. Furthermore, they are likely to be found in organizations reflecting their own affinity for activism. Work decreases the extent to which women volunteer but does not affect their propensity for activism. Prior volunteer experience partially offsets some of the decreased time devoted to voluntarism due to work. Implications regarding the relationship between voluntarism and activism and for promoting voluntary activism in general are discussed."
154	1997	NVSQ	26:02:00	Altruism Toward Groups: The Charitable Provision of Private Goods	"One form of altruism is the voluntary provision of public goods. Theories of altruism based on the public goods model, however, lead to false predictions of giving only by the very wealthiest members of large groups and of dollar-for-dollar crowding out of private giving by government spending. In this article, donors are assumed to care about the provision of a private good to members of a recipient group. The model is shown to be consistent with widespread giving and less than complete crowding out."
155	1997	NVSQ	26:02:00	Multiple Constituencies and the Social Construction of Nonprofit Organization Effectiveness	"Based on the social constructionism perspective and a multiple constituency model, this study investigates stakeholder judgments of nonprofit charitable organization effectiveness. The study also uses a Delphi process to identify criteria that some practitioner w-experts regard as objective indicators of effectiveness. Data on various stakeholder judgments of organizational effectiveness and on the objective indicators were collected for a sample of 64 organizations, allowing for examination of the extent to which stakeholder judgments are consistent and for examination of the extent to which judgments are related to objective indicators. Among the major results of the study are that practitioner-experts define objective effectiveness as employing correct procedures, stakeholders frequently vary substantially in their judgments of the effectiveness of the same organization, stakeholder judgments of effectiveness seldom are related to objective (correct procedures) effectiveness, and different types of stakeholders use some of the same-most notably, board effectiveness-as well as different bases for making effectiveness judgments. Conclusions and implications are discussed."
156	1997	NVSQ	26:02:00	The Influence of Demographics and Distance on Nonprofit Location	"This article investigates the relationship between socioeconomic characteristics and the provision of nonprofit services for census block groups in Dallas County, Texas. We find that the number of health, education, and social service nonprofits in a given area is positively influenced by block group income, age, percentage minority, and racial heterogeneity, and negatively influenced by income heterogeneity and age heterogeneity. On further examination, we find a complex pattern of relationships between income and age and number of providers that suggests researchers should exercise caution when using these variables. Also, in all of our results the effects of the demographic variables are by far the strongest for nonprofits within one mile of the block group centroid, they weaken as they get farther from the centroid. This shows that nonprofits are most heavily influenced by the characteristics of the neighborhoods directly around them."
157	1997	NVSQ	26:03:00	Grassroots Associations are Important: Some Theory and a Review of the Impact Literature	"Grassroots associations (GAs) are defined as locally based and wholly volunteer nonprofits-essentially local voluntary associations, in sociological terms. Such associations are discussed in theoretical terms, examining pros and cons regarding their potential importance. On the basis of an extensive literature review, the internal impact of GAs involves the fostering of social support and mutual helping, stimulation and self-expression, happiness and health, sociopolitical activation, and economic and other outcomes among members. On the downside, some GA activity (e.g.., in delinquent gangs) can increase individual deviance among members. Externally, GAs often create positive change, enable continuing citizen participation in a democracy and a viable civil society, provide varied services to nonmembers, help maintain societal cohesion, and can help in disasters. GAs also help support the economic system and stimulate program volunteering, philanthropic giving, and other GA activity. Cumulatively, grassroots associations have a very substantial effect on society and on the lives of its citizens, especially in modern nations like America."
158	1997	NVSQ	26:03:00	Voluntary Organizations and Advocacy: The Case of Housing for Older Americans	"This article provides a brief overview of nonprofit organizations and advocacy that outlines the multiple forms that advocacy might take and introduces a conceptual frame work for understanding better the discursive attributes of advocacy. Housing opportunities for older people in the United States are then reviewed, focusing in particular on the role of nonprofit organizations. This brief historical review provides the context for a consideration of the ways in which nonprofits have advocated on behalf of elderly people, in debates about housing, looking in particular at representations made at the Select Committee on Aging. Conclusions address matters relating to both housing in particular and the role of nonprofits in a more general view."
159	1997	NVSQ	26:03:00	The Ecumenical Outreach Coalition: A Case Study of Converging Interests and Network Formation for Church and Community Cooperation	"This study examines the formation of a particular ecumenical coalition of churches that emerged in response to decaying neighborhood conditions. An Open Systems Role-Set Theory is applied to a qualitative case study of interchurch cooperation. This model examines the process through which this new organization resulted in changes in leaders social networks, which led to changes in strategies for community outreach. Although this study focused specifically on an ecumenical alliance of religious congregations, leadership networks and coalitions generate cooperation and/or competition between agencies throughout the independent sector. One basic theme that emerges from this study suggests that the makeup of, and political dynamics within, leaders role sets drive the process through which organizational decisions are made and resources are allocated."
160	1997	NVSQ	26:03:00	Nonresponse Bias in Organizational Surveys: Evidence from a Survey of Groups and Organizations Working for Peace	"Nonresponse bias is a major concern for scholars using survey research, as low response rates can lead to serious problems in the generalizability of survey results. Numerous studies have been made to estimate the effects of nonresponse bias on survey results, but these have typically considered only surveys treating individual respondents as the unit of analysis. Organizational theory should lead scholars, however, to expect important differences between individual and organizational survey designs in the sources and effects of nonresponse bias. In this article, the author compares characteristics of organizations responding to a survey of organizations working for peace with those of organizations that failed to respond. The analysis shows that organizational informants behave differently from individual survey targets and that a theory of nonresponse bias in organizational surveys is needed to improve organizational survey designs so as to minimize and account for nonresponse bias."
161	1997	NVSQ	26:4(supp)	The Role of Small Religious Nonprofits in Changing Urban Neighborhoods	"Small religious nonprofits (SRNPs) provide a variety of services to residents of low-income center-city neighborhoods, but the magnitude and effectiveness of their service contribution are difficult to assess and evaluate. A preliminary field study of SRNPs in selected communities in Philadelphia and in Trenton, New Jersey, that have undergone profound neighborhood social and demographic change has identified widespread prevalence of SRNPs in these communities and deep commitment to address their service needs. Detailed neighborhood studies are needed to examine comparatively how SRNPs and secular agencies respond and adjust to altered service demands, client populations, and financing options."
162	1997	NVSQ	26:4(supp)	Philanthropic Institutions and the Small Religious Nonprofit	"Based on information gathered from small religious nonprofits (SRNPs) and philanthropic organizations in the Chicago area, this article finds that SRNPs may have difficulties obtaining foundation grants due to their mode of operation and the misconceptions of some grant-making officers. By pinpointing specific areas of misunderstanding, both donors and SRNPs are offered the opportunity to revise those assumptions and practices that impede cooperation. The findings of this study suggest that although there is substantial interest and goodwill extended between the two populations studied, there are also vast gulfs in the knowledge and expectations the sectors hold for one another. As a consequence, opportunities are unnecessarily for gone for receiving, as well as for conveying, philanthropic gifts. Despite this discouraging news, there is every reason to believe that these problems may be addressed through education and enhanced communication. The article concludes by offering practical recommendations to close the gap between SRNPs and grant-making institutions."
163	1997	NVSQ	26:4(supp)	"Governance and the Small, Religiously Affiliated Social Service Provider"	"Religiously affiliated providers of social services are becoming increasingly important in the transformation of social welfare policy in the United States. This article focuses on governance issues and challenges facing these small service providers. Using perspectives from the organization and management literatures and examples from prior research, the article makes three general observations. First, predictable patterns of governance exist, depending on the types of structural relationships religiously affiliated agencies have with their religious bases. Second, governance will be affected by particular characteristics of both small and religious organizations. Third, growth presents critical challenges to the ability of these providers to maintain their indigenous religious cultures. Hypotheses are offered to stimulate further research in each of these areas."
164	1997	NVSQ	26:4(supp)	"The Formation, Transitions, and Evolution of Small Religious Organizations"	"The goal of this article is to identify and explore the patterns of formation and development of smaller religious nonprofit service organizations-those that often begin in the basements of some religious congregations-and to examine the transitions that they go through to become viable, self-sustaining entities. Based on a review of the available literature and extensive fieldwork, the authors propose insights into these issues as well as suggestions regarding when external intervention and support are worthwhile."
165	1997	NVSQ	26:4(supp)	Unto Thy Maker: The Fate of Church-Based Nonprofit Clinics in a Turbulent Health Care Environment	"Despite the explosive growth of the nonprofit sector in recent years, many charitable organizations have closed their doors. Evolution of the health care delivery system in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area in Minnesota has favored large, integrated service networks at the expense of small, church-based nonprofit organizations that have long served as a means of neighborhood organizing, social outreach, and the proliferation of community values. Interviews with three defunct church-based health care organizations provide the basis for the authors observations that relatively sudden and wide-scale changes in the health care environment have legislated against small health care organizations, selecting them out for extinction."
166	1997	NVSQ	26:4(supp)	"Financial Management and Accountability in Small, Religiously Affiliated Nonprofit Organizations"	"Although small, religiously affiliated nonprofit organizations share financial management and accountability challenges with other small nonprofit organizations, they tend to face issues and problems that differ from those of small secular nonprofit organizations. Exploratory research methods were used to develop hypotheses about the nature and likely origins of the financial management challenges of small, religiously affiliated nonprofit organizations. The article delineates financial management and accountability challenges common to all small nonprofit organizations and contrasts them to small businesses. It then proposes and discusses the hypothesized origins of financial management and accountability issues unique to or different in small, religiously affiliated nonprofit organizations. A life-cycle framework for small religious nonprofits is developed and differentiated from the life cycle of small secular nonprofit organizations. A small survey provided supportive, but not statistically significant, results, showing that larger small, religiously affiliated nonprofit organizations are more likely to have separate budgets and accounting records"
167	1997	NVSQ	26:4(supp)	Determining Frames of Reference for Religiously Based Organizations: A Case of Neo-Alinsky Efforts to Mobilize Congregational Resources	"This article provides an organizational analysis that addresses the challenge of studying community-based groups lacking the characteristics of formal, rational organizations, doing so through the use of social and moral theory. It first addresses prominent schools of research in the contemporary sociology of religion as influenced particularly by resource mobilization and rational choice theories. In the course of so doing, it demonstrates the adequacy and limitations of resource mobilization theory for understanding religiously based organizations."
168	1997	NVSQ	26:4(supp)	Organization from Community: A Case Study of Congregational Renewal	"This article is a case study of one minister's effort at congregational renewal in a small-town, mainline Protestant church that had persistently lost members as the congregation aged. Although the article describes the minister, his efforts, and his church, the main goal is to show how we may view organizations as subcomponents of the communities in which they exist. The article explicitly conceptualizes this church renewal effort as an example of an organizational type first proposed by Janowitz in describing the community press in urban settings. To move beyond the business model of organizations in analyzing nonprofit organizations, we need to find conceptual models that represent clear alternatives. We also need case examples that clearly illustrate those conceptual alternatives. This case is offered in that spirit."
169	1997	NVSQ	26:04:00	The Role of Fictions in the Redefinition of Mission	"Although much emphasis has been placed on a nonprofit organization's definition of mission and the extent to which it can be translated into specific performance criteria, the language that satisfies bureaucratic agencies is seldom the same as that which generates moral allegiance. The case of the National Trust for Historic Preservation reveals a nonprofit organization in the process of changing its mission from one based on architectural conservation toward one committed to rebuilding American communities. The author argues that this new mission takes the form of a 'fiction,  with fictions defined as instruments of cultural imagination that lead to the re enchantment of the world.  The author provides three criteria by which this and similar organizational fictions can be evaluated. Whether such missions-as-fictions are exportable and how they relate to the broader organizational field are also considered."
170	1997	NVSQ	26:04:00	"Conflict, Legitimacy, and Effectiveness: Who Speaks for Whom in Transnational NGO Networks Lobbying the World Bank?"	"Networks of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have gained a measure of influence in policy and funding debates for the multilateral development banks, particularly the World Bank (WB). Addressing organizations owned and governed by member states, they have raised issues of environmental impact, economic and social justice, political participation, and the rights of minorities (sometimes majorities) usually excluded from national and global decision making. With their success have come pressures that reveal tensions and contradictions in the networks representation, agenda setting, self-governance, and claims to legitimacy. These tensions can be traced to the networks position in a changing international political economy. They have weakened the NGOs influence with the WB and its major member states and are now stimulating proposals and initiatives to change the networks self-governance."
171	1997	NVSQ	26:04:00	Balancing Acts: What Charter Schools Teach Us about Government-Nonprofit Contracting	"When a government agency and a nonprofit organization enter into a contract to provide a public service, each party must perform a delicate balancing act. The nonprofit organization must weigh the benefits of engagement with the public sector against the perils of entanglement. The government agency must afford the nonprofit organization enough autonomy to benefit from its flexibility and creativity, all the while holding the private organization accountable for furthering public purposes. This article develops a typology of technical, organizational, and contextual factors that may affect each party's ability to strike its balance and then uses this typology to analyze the experiences of governments and quasi-nonprofit charter schools in three states: Colorado, Massachusetts, and Michigan."
172	1997	NVSQ	26:04:00	"Civil Society, Differential Resources, and Organizational Development: HIV/AIDS Organizations in New York City, 1982-1992"	"This article addresses two practical and theoretical issues: the role of nonprofits in the implementation of social policies and studies of organizational development. It considers two questions: (a) What is the impact of differential levels of community resources on the founding and evolution of new organizations? (b) Does the classic organizational life cycle model apply to new organizations or are there other patterns of organizational development? Drawing on case studies of l6 nonprofit organizations that were established to 'fight the HIV/AIDS epidemic, the article points to the synergistic relationship between nonprofits and social policy development and the impact of varied levels of resources and social capital in the creation of new nonprofit organizations."
173	1997	NVSQ	26:04:00	Shifting the Prism: Case Explications of Institutional Analysis in Nonprofit Organizations	"Teachers of nonprofit organization studies, nonprofit practitioners, and consultants are increasingly dissatisfied with the standard management model approach to solving organizational problems in nonprofits. The standard model provides rational fixes to complex organizational issues that miss the contextual, dynamic, and varied environments in which nonprofits operate. This article proposes that an institutional analysis approach represents an important alternative to the standard model because it views nonprofit organizations as embedded in and subcomponents of larger communal and organizational systems. The article explores five elements that distinguish the institutional analysis approach from the standard model: (1) the organization should be considered to exist in social systems, (2) cultural influences that shape organizational behavior must be sought out and analyzed, (3) a variety of constituencies are likely to be important and powerful, (4) coercive influences often shape nonprofits, and (5) organizations operate simultaneously within horizontal and vertical interorganizational networks. Five case studies explicate each of these elements, providing new strategies for resolving the complex organizational issues facing nonprofit organizations."
174	1997	NVSQ	26:04:00	Transnationalizing Community Development: The Case of Migration between Boston and the Dominican Republic	"This article explores the impact of transnationalism on organizational performance through a study of an organization spanning Boston and the Dominican Republic. Because growing numbers of migrants sustain strong, long-term ties to their countries of origin, these kinds of transnational migrant organizations are becoming increasingly common. Transnational activism enhanced organizational performance at the same time that it constrained it. The organization contributed significantly to sending-community development. A more diverse, highly-skilled group of residents participated. The organization functioned more efficiently and accountably, and the community enhanced its position vis-ö-vis the state. The benefits of transnationality were not without cost. A sharp division of labor between donors and beneficiaries meant that nonmigrant interests sometimes received short shrift. There were significant ebbs and flows in activism. Finally, the community's heightened ability to solve its problems set a precedent that allowed the Dominican government to pursue policies unfavorable to rural development."
175	1997	NVSQ	26:04:00	Emergent Order and Self-Organization: A Case Study of Alcoholics Anonymous	"Based on a case study of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), the authors argue that some self-help organizations are able to translate their tradition of group-level experiential learning into unique organization-wide learning cultures. The underlying premise of such learning cultures is that organization-level structures and processes evolve in response to group-level experiences. Instead of adopting a rigidly centralized, top-down approach, some self-help organizations appear to be driven by the collective needs and experiences of their member groups. In some cases, the most critical role of the central organizing body is to create a context within which multiple, diverse local groups are allowed to organize themselves according to their unique circumstances, opportunities, and challenges. The article uses a perspective in which it is possible to understand AA's approach to organization as the enactment of a self-organizing, emergent design process that is driven by an organizational culture of experiential learning and explores the relevance of this to other self-help organizations."
176	1998	NVSQ	27:01:00	Mapping Small Religious Nonprofit Organizations: An Illinois Profile	"Small religious nonprofit organizations in the human service field are relatively invisible to researchers, reflecting in part their disproportionate omission from the Internal Revenue Service list of charitable nonprofits. Drawing on a 1991 survey of Illinois nonprofit human service organizations, the authors describe their organizational and financial characteristics as well as their governance structures and relations with religious congregations. The authors conclude that the organizations are internally diverse and also differ in significant ways from their nonreligious counterparts in the field. Finally, the authors present research and policy implications."
177	1998	NVSQ	27:01:00	Emergence and Development of Bulgaria's Environmental Movement	"An environmental movement emerged in Bulgaria in the late 1980s around which regime dissent coalesced. Success was achieved in bringing an end to the communist state, but environmental problems were not resolved. Environmental issues now must be tackled within a developing pluralistic political system and its new political elite and within a struggling market economy. As Tarrow suggests in his cycles of protest thesis, new repertoires of political action are available to the environmental movement along with new political opportunities for it to seize. This study of the Bulgarian environmental movement suggests that even when a social movement secures significant success, far from bringing an end to activity, the movement is likely to find that there are unresolved and even new issues to address that must be pursued under significantly changed political, social, and economic conditions."
178	1998	NVSQ	27:01:00	Effects of Organizational Type and Localism on Volunteerism and Resource Sharing During Disasters	"After a disaster, community consensus is at its highest. This suggests that geographic distance is a barrier to coordination. This study found that geographic distance is negatively related to links among organizations, but most of this relationship is accounted for by organizational variables, including geographic service range, volunteerism, and appreciation shown to volunteers. Organizations with a local orientation have lower levels of volunteerism. Compared to emergency management organization, social service organizations have larger geographic service ranges, a less localistic orientation, and more network links. This study suggests that social service organizations promote resource redistribution and network coordination, whereas emergency management organizations with limited service ranges tend to block resource redistribution and limit volunteer participation."
179	1998	NVSQ	27:01:00	Youth Socialization and Civic Participation: The Role of Secondary Schools in Promoting Community Service in Southern California	"The purpose of this research was to illuminate high schools roles in encouraging volunteer community service. The authors sought to answer four questions: (a) What is the extent and distribution of secondary schools that sponsor or provide volunteer service programs, (b) how do secondary schools promote or support volunteering among students, (c) what is the rationale for offering community service, and (d) what is the conceptual relationship between school auspices and community service offerings? The findings generally support the expected differences between public and private schools, for example, private religious schools are most likely to mandate service experiences for their students. However, the differences between private religious and nonsectarian schools need further elaboration. To the extent that civic participation is based on social interdependence and a sense of community responsibility or ownership, high school community service remains problematic as a means to socializing students into the role of civic participation."
180	1998	NVSQ	27:02:00	Doing it their Way: Organizational Challenges for Voluntary Associations	"Nonprofit scholars have generally paid little attention to the organizational features of voluntary associations. This article starts to fill this gap in nonprofit scholarship. It proposes five key challenges of associational organization: meeting long-term goals and individual member's needs, balancing member-benefit and public-benefit goals, setting priorities in the face of competing interests, controlling member volunteers, and integrating paid staff. The article suggests that voluntary associations are conceptually and organizationally distinguish able from the bureaucratic service-delivering agencies of the broader nonprofit sector and merit specific research attention to build descriptive data and specialist theory."
181	1998	NVSQ	27:02:00	Measuring the Effectiveness of Nonprofit Boards	"The Board Self-Assessment Questionnaire (BSAQ) was developed to assess board performance in six areas that previous research has shown to characterize highly effective boards. Data from 623 board members in 34 nonprofit organizations were used to examine this instrument's reliability, validity, and sensitivity, including the relationship between board scores and selected indicators of the organization's financial performance. Results indicate that the BSAQ is a sound and useful tool for evaluating board performance."
182	1998	NVSQ	27:02:00	Measuring the Unmeasurable: Empirical Studies of Nonprofit Organization Effectiveness from 1977 to 1997	"The subject of organizational effectiveness in nonprofit organizations, although controversial, remains important to both practitioners and researchers. In spite of this, the empirical research on the subject has never been comprehensively reviewed. This article reviews empirical studies of nonprofit effectiveness from the past 20 years. The review reveals that researchers have conceptualized effectiveness in a variety of ways and that the research objectives pursued in the study of effectiveness have changed over time. The review also shows that much recent research has employed an emergent or social constructionist approach to effectiveness that emphasizes issues of process over measurement."
183	1998	NVSQ	27:02:00	"Access, Hospital Ownership, and Competition between For-Profit and Nonprofit Institutions"	"The authors argue that past studies of ownership inadequately control for the ways in which competition alters ownership-related differences. Survey data from 1975, 1980, and 1986 are used to estimate the changing effect of hospital ownership and between-sector competition on access to inpatient psychiatric care over a period when for-profit competition was increasing. Results show that during the noncompetitive period (1975), nonprofit psychiatric hospitals were more willing to admit costly patients. As cross-ownership competition increased, nonprofit hospitals became more willing to admit uninsured and underinsured patients, but they also grew more sensitive to cost of care. For-profit hospitals became more sensitive to the generosity of reimbursement but less sensitive to cost of care."
184	1998	NVSQ	27:03:00	The Impact of Professional Solicitors on Fund-Raising in Charitable Organizations	"Donors claim that information about the fund-raising methods used by a charity is important to them, and the press periodically high lights fund-raising scandals and abuses, which fuels negative public attitudes. However, there is little systematic empirical research about fund-raising practices. This study examined professional solicitor contracts using information provided by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's Bureau of Charitable Organizations. The nature of the contracts, the impact of these contractual arrangements on the amount of funds the clients ultimately receive, and the relationship between actual and predicted returns were examined. Results showed that charities using professional solicitors tended to be larger and concentrated in the advocacy, disease/disorder, and public safety subsectors. Most campaigns generated few contributions and resulted in a small return to the charity, with many charities receiving nothing from the solicitations made in their names. Solicitors compensated by fixed-fee rather than by commission generated more contributions and provided proportionately greater returns to charities."
185	1998	NVSQ	27:03:00	Bandwagon or Band-Aid? A Model of Nonprofit Incorporation by State	"What accounts for the addition of new nonprofit organizations in different U.S. states? Do new nonprofit organizations answer calls for help (Band-Aid) or calls for proposals (bandwagon) at their inception? Are nonprofit entrepreneurs pushed by the failures of government and the market or pulled by the legitimacy of the organizational form? This comparative research models the level of nonprofit incorporation in different U.S. states given fragmented legal environments, variable organizational legitimacy, and different levels of social needs. Drawing from institutional, resource dependence, population ecology, and social movement theories and using data from state legal codes, judicial decisions, the U.S. census, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Nonprofit Almanac, 1992-1993, we explore the environmental and interorganizational forces that influence the level of nonprofit incorporation by state."
186	1998	NVSQ	27:03:00	Interagency Partnerships in Aid-Recipient Countries: Lessons from an Aquaculture Project in Bangladesh	"In aid-recipient countries, partnerships between government, donors, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are now a central feature of many development projects and programs, but partnership arrangements in practice are rarely subjected to detailed scrutiny. A distinct discourse of partnership has been produced by the present configuration of foreign donors, NGOs, and government in the aquaculture sector in Bangladesh, which sometimes adds value by improving effectiveness and sometimes does not, merely reinforcing various agency interests. Drawing on data emerging from a process documentation of this project, a new model of active as opposed to dependent partnership is emerging. This model emphasizes the processes, experiences, and perceptions of partnership as well as the planned project outputs. It envisages a role for NGOs that goes beyond service delivery and informs and challenges existing public sector policy and practice."
187	1998	NVSQ	27:03:00	Education and Advance Care Planning in Nursing Homes: The Impact of Ownership Type	"The study examined the association between ownership type and community benefit as measured by organizational approaches to patient, family, and community education. As a case study of the broader class of educational efforts, the inquiry focused on educational efforts regarding a central patient care issue for nursing homes: the use of life-sustaining medical treatment. Results indicated that nonprofit and for-profit nursing homes were equally likely to conduct educational efforts concerning advance care planning. However, nonprofit nursing homes were more likely than for-profit nursing homes to have ongoing, rather than sporadic, discussions about advance care planning, to broaden such discussions beyond life-support wishes, and to have ethics committees to support advance care planning. Other empirical research has demonstrated ownership differences in both cost and quality of care. This study offers new evidence regarding additional ways in which nonprofit long-term care facilities may be distinguished from their for-profit counterparts."
188	1998	NVSQ	27:03:00	A Model and Typology of Government-NGO Relationships	"This article develops a model and typology of government-nongovernmental organization (NGO) relationships to enable both a rapid appraisal of government-NGO relationships in a particular context and to identify the characteristics and possible structure of alternative relationship types. Building on the literature on the subject, the model defines eight possible relationship types based on several dimensions: government's resistance or acceptance of institutional pluralism, the relative balance of power in the relationship, and the degree of formality and by extension the level of government linkage. The model and typology are designed to assist governments, NGOs, donors, and other development practitioners to identify and promote the most productive government-NGO relationship for a particular context."
189	1998	NVSQ	27:04:00	Can AmeriCorps Build Communities?	"One of the most ambitious and simultaneously most controversial programs of Bill Clinton's presidency is AmeriCorps, the national service program authorized in 1993 by the National and Community Service Trust Act. This article presents findings from an examination of the community-building effects of the AmeriCorps program in five communities. We focus our attention on AmeriCorps impact on local community-based organizations by examining change in the capacity of the organizations in which AmeriCorps members work and in the degree to which AmeriCorps has fostered interorganizational cooperation to achieve community goals. We conclude with a discussion of the findings and ways to enhance AmeriCorps community-building potential."
190	1998	NVSQ	27:04:00	Expanding the Governance Construct: Functions and Contributions of Nonprofit Advisory Groups	"Despite continuing interest in nonprofit governance issues, little debate has occurred about the identity of participants in governance other than trustees and executive staff. This article finds, however, that advisory groups are also a critical instrument of governance in many public benefit organizations with government grants or contracts. Advisory group members perform numerous primary organizational activities, link nonprofits to key stakeholder groups in the environment, and strengthen ties of cooperation and shared purpose with other community actors. They supplement governance activities carried out by nonprofit boards of directors. In addition, some groups establish new ties to various elites, others connect or reconnect nonprofits to grassroots community constituencies. Nonprofit governance theory should take into account the functions and contributions to governance of advisory groups."
191	1998	NVSQ	27:04:00	Counting Latino Nonprofits: A New Strategy for Finding Data	"Surprisingly little data is available on Latino nonprofits in the United States. The author describes a new content analysis strategy for extracting Latino subsets from large data sets that lack Hispanic identifiers. The strategy was used to generate statistics on Latino nonprofits from data on tax-exempt organizations compiled by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Findings indicate that Latino nonprofits comprise less than four tenths of 1% of all tax-exempt organizations. A relatively high proportion (two thirds) of all Latino nonprofits recognized by the IRS are recognized under I.R.C. ¤ 501(c)(3). Half of all Latino nonprofits are less than 10 years old. Latino nonprofits tend not to affiliate with other organizations. They are concentrated in the southwestern United States. Popular activities among Latino nonprofits are programs for veterans, scholarship and educational programs, and promotion of business and commerce. Rare activities include youth services, legislative and political activities, litigation, and legal aid."

This article suggests ways of tracing the development and differentiation of organizational forms through empirical analyses of the built environment and argues that this approach offers valuable insight into the history of nonprofit charitable organizations, public-private partnerships, and citizen participation in a developing democracy. The main focus is on how charitable practices operated within buildings and how different buildings used by charitable organizations in the 19th century limited and defined social service provision. Investigating the ways in which early organizational struggles over space influenced, constrained, and/or enabled organizational institutionalization can lead to greater understandings of American civil society."
193	1998	NVSQ	27:04:00	"Nonprofit Advocacy Organizations: Assessing the Definitions, Classifications, and Data"	"This article reviews how research on nonprofit organizations has traditionally defined advocacy and its function in the public policy process as rights-based expression and association and suggests the usefulness of an expanded definition. Nonprofits participate in a variety of public decisions at different points in the policy cycle. The authors argue that building social capital, facilitating civic participation, and providing public voice are activities central to an analysis of the interaction of nonprofits and public policy in democratic civil society. The article also analyzes the IRS data sets and National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE) classification system available to researchers from the National Center for Charitable Statistics (NCCS) to assess their strengths and weaknesses for measuring advocacy activities. By evaluating the problems in accurately describing, analyzing, and collecting data on nonprofit organizations that facilitate a public role in decision making, this article develops some alternative definitions and models of advocacy."
194	1998	NVSQ	27:04:00	International Grant Making by U.S. Foundations: Issues and Directions in the 1990s	"This article summarizes findings from the Foundation Center's 1997 benchmark study International Grantmaking: A Report on U.S. Foundation Trends. The study's purpose study was to foster better understanding among funders and the international community about the role foundations play in the international field and the ways they practice international grant making and to identify changes in giving patterns and practice in the post-cold war era. Over the past 15 years, the share of funding for international programs has doubled. Such growth suggests a dynamic area whose directions need to be understood. Those involved with international grant making and the international community-in the United States and overseas-need to understand changes in funding patterns within the context of domestic funding policies and in response to external factors. Deeper understanding of recent trends can also encourage dialogue about the evolving purpose of international grant making in the era of globalization."
195	1999	NVSQ	28:01:00	Assessing the Value of Volunteer Activity	"One standard way to convert estimates of time volunteered into estimates of the dollar value of volunteered time is to multiply estimated hours by the average hourly compensation rate for paid labor. Economic theory suggests an alternative valuation strategy that acknowledges the importance of taxes, the provision of volunteer-assisted services at less- than-market prices, and the value of volunteer experiences captured by volunteers themselves. One conclusion is that the standard estimate overstates the value of volunteering to the recipients of volunteer-assisted services but understates the overall value of volunteering when the gains accruing to volunteers themselves are included."
196	1999	NVSQ	28:01:00	"Structural Changes in the Hospital Industry, Charity Care, and the Nonprofit Role in Health Care"	"In an effort to understand the impact of cost-containment public policies on the relative roles of the sectors, the authors examine changes in the California hospital industry during the 1980s and associated changes in the provision of charity care. Industry structure and the relative strength of the sectors change as a result of industry entry, industry exit, and conversions (ownership changes across sectors). In the face of cost-containment policies, the nonprofit sector has been the most stable, with fewer exits than the for-profit sector and fewer conversions out than the public sector. This stability suggests that nonprofit hospitals are more likely to continue providing services as profit margins shrink. In addition, an analysis of the charity care behavior of converters suggests a stronger relationship between ownership and charity behavior than indicated by simple comparisons of the mean levels of provision, with committed nonprofits providing more charity care than for-profit hospitals."
197	1999	NVSQ	28:01:00	Do Public Subsidies Leverage Private Philanthropy for the Arts? Empirical Evidence on Symphony Orchestras	"The relationship between public subsidies and private philanthropy is at the heart of a common claim that state subsidies leverage private donations to the arts. This claim might seem counterintuitive to some who find it more likely that state funding would crowd out private donations. This article empirically tests this question, using panel data on five major American symphony orchestras. The principal result of the statistical analysis is that neither claim is correct for these orchestras: The two funding sources are independent. This finding has significant managerial implications with respect to revenue-raising strategies for arts organizations as well as nonprofit firms in general. These implications and several related policy issues are discussed."
198	1999	NVSQ	28:01:00	The Benefits and Costs of Volunteering in Community Organizations: Review and Practical Implications	"The authors reviewed the literature of the benefits and costs associated with participation in voluntary organizations. The literature shows that benefits and costs can be measured, are related to participation, and can be managed by voluntary organization leaders. Therefore, understanding benefits and costs is important because they can be used to enhance participation in voluntary groups. Membership, activity level, and different organization types are ways in which researchers have examined benefits and costs. Researchers have also collapsed benefit and cost items into factors and constructed a direct ratio of benefits to costs. Practical implications of the research are discussed, and recommendations are given to refine future research efforts."
199	1999	NVSQ	28:02:00	Theses on Nonprofit Organizational Effectiveness	"This article draws from the general literature on organizational effectiveness and the specialized literature on nonprofit organizational effectiveness to advance six theses about the effectiveness of public benefit charitable nonprofit organizations (NPOs). (a) Non-profit organizational effectiveness is always a matter of comparison. (b) Nonprofit organizational effectiveness is multidimensional and will never be reducible to a single measure. (c) Boards of directors make a difference in the effectiveness of NPOs, but how they do this is not clear. (d) More effective NPOs are more likely to use correct management practices. (e) Nonprofit organizational effectiveness is a social construction. (f) Program outcome indicators as measures of NPO effectiveness are limited and can be dangerous. The article concludes by considering three possible futures for NPO effectiveness research."
200	1999	NVSQ	28:02:00	"The Effects of Expanded Donor Choice in United Way Campaigns on Nonprofit Human Service Providers in the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Area"	"In January 1994, the United Way of the National Capital Area announced significant changes in its methods of funds distribution. These structural shifts in the Washington, D.C.-area United Way campaign created an environment of increased fiscal and organizational pressure for nonprofits as many scrambled to make up lost ground. This article reports the findings of a survey sent to 258 D.C.-area nonprofit service providers. The survey was designed to determine how nonprofits adapted to changes in their funding environment associated with changes in the United Way campaign. Half of the groups surveyed experienced moderate or large cuts in the amount of funds they received through the United Way. Yet, a majority of the organizations that experienced cuts were able to adapt in ways that allowed them to maintain service levels. A number of these adaptations involved attempts to manage the environment in a manner consistent with resource dependency theory."
201	1999	NVSQ	28:02:00	"Nonprofit Decision Making and Resource Allocation: The Importance of Membership Preferences, Community Needs, and Interorganizational Ties"	"Data on 12 local chapters of a high status women's community service organization and their communities are used to assess the relative impact of community needs, members' perceptions and preferences, and interorganizational ties on decisions about how to allocate volunteers and funds among 17 community problem areas. Quantitative analysis indicates that the distribution of volunteer time and funds was unrelated to community needs as measured by objective indicators. Instead, members' and leaders' perceptions of the severity of community problems and their willingness to work in some problem areas more than others were the most important determinants of resource allocation. Qualitative evidence also suggests that members' ties to other organizations played a role in the chapters' decisions about project selection."
202	1999	NVSQ	28:02:00	Corporate Philanthropy: What Is the Strategy?	"Strategic philanthropy, according to the literature, is becoming the state of the art in corporate contribution management. The term is defined in this study as the process by which contributions are targeted to meet business objectives and recipient needs. It represents the integration of philanthropy into the overall strategic planning of the corporation. Given this trend, this research examines the extent to which corporate philanthropy has become predominantly a business deal with direct and measurable financial returns to shareholders. The study presents the results of a national survey of corporate direct contribution programs. The 226 corporations that responded to the mailed questionnaire were primarily large corporations from over 20 different industries. The findings suggest that contributions made directly by corporations are primarily used in less tangible ways to meet responsibilities to employees and their communities"
203	1999	NVSQ	28:02:00	Trends in Voluntary Association Participation	"Researchers have claimed that trends in voluntary association participation provide the starting point for examinations of social capital, a reflection of the quality of social ties at the individual or community level of analysis. This research addresses the link between participation in voluntary associations and social capital by examining trends in U.S. participation levels over a 21-year period. Using data from the General Social Survey (1974-1994), the findings demonstrate that, although aggregate voluntary association participation decreased between 1974 and 1984, participation increased in the later half of the time period. Further analyses disaggregating participation by the type of voluntary association demonstrate that participation in all but four types of association either increased or remained stable over the period. The article concludes with implications for future research exploring the relationship between voluntary association participation and social capital."
204	1999	NVSQ	28:03:00	Diversification of Revenue Strategies: Evolving Resource Dependence in Nonprofit Organizations	"This article examines the effects of three major revenue strategies in nonprofit organizations. Evolving resource dependence is demonstrated by the shifting reliance on each source of funds: private contributions, government funding, and commercial activities. A wide-ranging literature review is condensed into summary profiles comparing revenue volatility, goal displacement, process, and structure effects of each strategy. The profiles are drawn upon to anticipate potential advantages and disadvantages of increasingly diversified revenue strategies employed by nonprofits to combat resource dependence. The potential interaction effects raise critical but unanswered questions about nonprofit performance, legitimacy, and public policy issues."
205	1999	NVSQ	28:03:00	Trusting that of God in Everyone: Three Examples of Quaker-Based Social Service in Disadvantaged Communities	"This article explores the concept of social capital through case studies of three Quaker based social service organizations engaged in work in disadvantaged communities. Social capital represents relationships among members of a community built on shared understandings, behaviors, and patterns of trust. Accessing the social capital resources of a community often depends on exhibiting the cultural capital of network members. The article illustrates two points: (a) successfully mobilizing the social capital of a religious body depends on the ability of religious-based organizations to maintain both network relations and appropriate cultural capital behaviors expected by members of the founding religion, and (b) sharing social capital can take several forms. Organizations can use religious-based resources to serve outsiders without expanding boundaries to include the communities served, to expand social capital by enculturating newcomers into their practices, or to change the cultural cues considered appropriate to access the social resources of the religious organization."
206	1999	NVSQ	28:03:00	A Study of Factors Influencing the Growth of Nonprofits in Social Services	"This exploratory study identifies and assesses the significance of factors that contribute to the growth of the nonprofit sector in the field of social services across 285 major metropolitan areas in the United States. Measures derived from social cohesion, demand heterogeneity, market failure, resource dependence, and philanthropic culture theories are introduced to correlation and multiple regression analyses. All but the philanthropic culture measures are positively associated with the growth of the nonprofit sector in social services. Particularly noteworthy are the positive influences that religious cohesion and interdenominational diversity have on numbers of nonprofit social service providers, a finding that reaffirms the historical linkage between religion and voluntary associations. Summary U.S. economic and sociodemographic census data, as well as data from a unique religious census, are analyzed. If a unifying theory of the nonprofit sector is attainable, studies such as this should contribute to laying the empirical building blocks for such a theory."
207	1999	NVSQ	28:03:00	The Distribution of Public-Private Partnerships: Targeting of Voluntary Efforts to Improve Urban Education	"With increasing activity of volunteers in service provision, effectively managing voluntary involvement is a significant issue for local governments. This study examines the distribution of school-business and school-community-based-organization partnerships as voluntary efforts to improve urban education. This study uses multivariate regression analysis to examine the distribution of partnership programs as a function of school-level characteristics. Based on a consideration of the motivations for founding partnerships and the scope and sponsorship of the partnerships, several hypotheses are proposed. The study finds differences in the targeting to schools and students in the most need based on the scope of effort and the sponsorship. The findings have implications for the management and organization of partnerships in public schools."
208	1999	NVSQ	28:03:00	Nonprofits in Organizational Sociology's Research Traditions: An Empirical Study	"Neoinstitutional, population ecology, and resource dependence research traditions enjoy enduring popularity in the American organization science and sociological literature. Such research traditions are advanced through empirical studies of organizations non-profit, public, and for-profit. Noting some nonprofit lineage of the aforementioned traditions, this empirical study seeks to measure the use of sectors' organizations in the advancement of generalized organization theory. To do this, the author develops and explores three research questions about the current uses of the research traditions and organizational samples, by sector, in journals of organization theory. A brief discussion of findings and implications follows."
209	1999	NVSQ	28:03:00	A Foot in the Door: Strategic Dissemination of Nonprofit Sector Research to Congress	"Should nonprofit sector researchers adjust their research agendas for Capitol Hill? The answer is an unqualified yes, especially if Congress is meant as one of the audiences for such research. No think tank researcher working in the nation's capital conducts studies without some inkling that his or her research will inform and influence policy discussions on the Hill. Importantly for social scientists, 100% of congressional staff members interviewed for this study acknowledged that ideology affects how they analyze research. Non-profit sector researchers should consequently observe five strategies to overcome ideological biases and improve their credibility on the Hill: (a) aggressively market briefing papers to congressional staff members, (b) focus on local rather than national studies, (c) share data with other think tanks, (d) send research findings to relevant government agencies, and (e) collaborate on joint initiatives with strange bedfellows."
210	1999	NVSQ	28: supp 1	The Challenges of Globalization for Northern International Relief and Development NGOs	"This article begins by describing the process and effects of globalization over the past 20 years. With the decline in state capacity, changes in the global economy, and the end of the cold war, the environment within which NGOs operate has been much changed. As a result, NGOs have been forced to face the challenges of globalization of the NGO sector. The authors detail how relief and development organizations have responded to these challenges, both internally and externally, and also propose new possibilities for global NGO cooperation and network building."
211	1999	NVSQ	28: supp 1	International Development NGOs: Agents of Foreign Aid or Vehicles for International Cooperation?	"What is the future for development NGOs who work internationally but are based in and governed from the industrialized world? Are they destined for redundancy as NGOs and other organizations rooted in southern societies take over their roles and replace their expertise, or will they retain a legitimate place on the world stage in the 21st century? This article looks at the changing context for international NGOs and lays out three alternative routes into the future: incremental change (which is probably unsustainable), global market brands, and international social movements. The implications of each strategy are presented, and some overall conclusions drawn. The fundamental question facing all NGOs is how to move from their current position as agents of a foreign aid system in decline to vehicles for international co-operation in the emerging global arena."
212	1999	NVSQ	28: supp 1	Globalization and Its Effects on NGOs: Efflorescence or a Blurring of Roles and Relevance?	"This article begins by describing attributes of the NGO sector, including its phenomenal growth, its new legitimacy and reputation, and national and regional differences among NGOs. It then discusses the tensions, tradeoffs, trends, and strategies posed by globalization as the political economy in which NGOs operate is changed. It notes that in the global marketplace of altruism, NGOs risk seeing the positive promise of NGO globalization far outweighed by the dangers of commodification of their work. Finally, the author concludes that a return to the roots of altruistic activism may prove the best strategy in response to today's challenges."
213	1999	NVSQ	28: supp 1	Exploring StateCivil Society Collaboration: Policy Partnerships in Developing Countries	"This article examines state civil society partnerships for policy implementation, focusing on the basic factors partnerships need to deal with to be effective. These include specification of objectives and degree of convergence, mechanisms for combining effort and managing cooperation, determination of appropriate roles and responsibilities, and capacity to fulfill those roles and responsibilities. Four cases are presented, three from Africa and one from Eastern Europe. The cases are analyzed in an effort to identify the situational variables that influence state civil society partnerships, effective partnership mechanisms and processes, and management techniques and tools for supporting cooperative action. The article considers the applicability of strategic management approaches and tools to policy partnerships. Finally, it suggests a series of steps for governments to consider taking that hold the promise of strengthening the successful pursuit of state civil society partnerships."

This article is a profile of the northern international relief and development sector and how it is coping with these challenges, based on a study of 10 major organizations. Their concerns center on changing internal organizational culture to stay at the cutting edge, becoming more effective and exploring competition and cooperation. Externally, these organizations are developing strategies for improved north-south relations, advocacy, and autonomy."
215	1999	NVSQ	28: supp 1	The Challenges of Globalization of International Relief and Development	"This article begins with a look at the role played by Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) since its inception in 1971, and then looks at the challenges facing MSF today. It focuses on the confusion of humanitarian and political roles and on the goals MSF has laid out for itself to address this confusion. Humanitarian aid has become the favored response of governments to political crises, and governments have increasingly turned to NGOs to carry out their policies. In turn, NGOs have become increasingly dependent on governments for financial support. These changes have politicized aid delivery and made it difficult for NGOs to maintain their independence. In addition, as the number of NGOs increases and their activities become more specialized, there are pressures toward institutionalization and bureaucratization. To respond to these challenges, MSF has identified several goals, including maintaining organizational independence and flexibility and avoiding bureaucratization."

217	1999	NVSQ	28: supp 1	"Grappling With Globalization, Partnership, and Learning: A Look Inside Oxfam America"	"This article explores some of the current challenges facing Oxfam America, a Boston-based international development and relief organization. Looking outward, Oxfam America is faced with an increasingly competitive private fundraising market, tensions and opportunities posed by its affiliation with the global Oxfam International structure, the need to revitalize its partnership concept, unprecedented opportunities to link local realities and global policy formulation through advocacy, and the need to respond to changing programming contexts with new funding arrangements and strategic alliances. From an internal perspective, the organization is grappling with building a learning organization, creating more constructive labor-management relations, creating more flexible and entrepreneurial conditions of employment, institutionalizing strategic thinking and planning, and embracing diversity as a transformative management principle. Through creative yet pragmatic responses to these challenges, Oxfam America is striving to position itself as one of the most effective, forward-looking NGOs of the next century."
218	1999	NVSQ	28: supp 1	The Challenges of Globalization: Save the Children	"International NGOs must change and develop globally to capitalize on the opportunities of globalization and to face new challenges as they emerge. Concepts of national limitation are becoming increasingly incongruous with technological and economic development. There is an urgent need to create a democratic system at a global level. NGOs could push this forward. NGOs attempting to become global players will have to encompass the global community in their governance structures while tailoring their approaches to advocacy, programs, and fundraising to reflect specific national or regional styles and priorities. To survive and thrive in an environment of continuous change, NGOs will have to develop an internal culture of change. These demands will select all but a handful of highly professional global NGOs, a number of narrowly specialized (inter)national NGOs, and innumerable local neighborhood initiatives, not leaving much space for medium-sized or semiprofessional NGOs."
219	1999	NVSQ	28: supp 1	"Declining State Capacity, Voluntarism, and the Globalization of the Not-for-Profit Sector"	"Since the 1970s a profound shift has taken place in the roles of the public, private, and not-for-profit sectors. In the wake of fiscal crisis, ideological attacks, and privatization, the scope and capacity of governments has declined. A growing global not-for-profit sector has emerged, which has begun to fill the humanitarian vacuum left by the corporate sector and the nation-state. Changes have been profound, raising new issues about the role and future of voluntarism in a world where governments retreat from their social welfare responsibilities and where the solutions to global poverty continue to elude us. This article explores the rapid growth and internationalization of the NGO sector and addresses why the rapid growth of this sector is taking place, the structural forms this process is taking, and what future structural forms may emerge. In addition, the author analyzes issues that arise as the NGO sector globalizes, and discusses recommendations for constructive roles for policy makers and the northern international not-for-profit sector for promoting global voluntarism in the future."
220	1999	NVSQ	28: supp 1	New Dimensions of Global Advocacy	"This article argues that globalization impels NGOs to engage further in advocacy work, and that globalization provides important new opportunities as well as significant challenges. In particular, NGOs both north and south will have to form strategic alliances. The article uses Oxfam GB's history of advocacy to examine options open to NGOs and to suggest future directions and possible criteria for effective advocacy."
221	1999	NVSQ	28: supp 1	Evolving Global Structures and the Challenges Facing International Relief and Development Organizations	"Most current executives of the largest international relief and development organizations (NGOs) expect their organizations to move toward more global governance structures that incorporate fully vested partners from the north and south. This article seeks to present the potential opportunities and challenges of transition to a global governance structure. As NGOs have adapted their governance structures to the pressures of globalization, two variations of the international federation structure have emerged: the donor-member-dominated federation and the global bumblebee federation. The governance histories of World Vision International and Habitat for Humanity International reveal how these two structures may evolve. NGOs considering transition to a global governance structure can expect to deal with management issues such as role conflicts, staff management skills, and increased maintenance costs. Global structures provide the framework within which NGOs can engage multiple stakeholders, but global structures must be accompanied by complementary management systems to fully use their strengths and avoid their weaknesses."
222	1999	NVSQ	28:04:00	Volunteering and the Long Civic Generation	"By virtually every conceivable measure, civic participation is on the decline in America. Volunteering is one important exception. An analysis of a newly available archive of national surveys finds that the frequency with which Americans volunteer has increased 20% since the mid-1970s. However, nearly all of that increase is concentrated among older Americans, who are volunteering twice as frequent in the late 1990s as their same-aged predecessors did in the 1970s. Meanwhile, volunteering has actually decreased among middle-age adults, who once were the voluntary sector's most reliable source of donated labor. The reasons for increased volunteering among seniors remain elusive. Tests of various hypotheses, from improved health and financial conditions to increased spare time, do not explain the explosive increase. Nonetheless, it is clear that a powerful and mysterious force is pushing seniors toward greater volunteer involvement, and non-profit groups should tap into this particularly civic age group before the Indian summer of volunteering reaches its end."
223	1999	NVSQ	28:04:00	Relationships between Nonprofit and for-Profit Organizations: A Stakeholder Perspective	"The purpose of this article is to provide a new, more comprehensive stakeholder theory of the relationships between nonprofit, for-profit, and government sectors. This theory combines aspects of neoclassical economics and principal-agency theory to complement the traditional notions that these organizations either compete or exist in a vacuum relative to one another. The article discusses nonprofit organizations that are employee groups (unions and professional associations), shareholders (institutional investors including pension funds and endowments), community and other interest groups, government contractors, competitors, consumers, and suppliers. By viewing these organizations as agents relative to a principal for-profit (or government) organization, it is possible to hypothesize about relationships and behaviors between organizations of different sectors of the economy. This new perspective allows a better understanding of the many relationships observed in the nonprofit sector and of a much greater range of nonprofit stakeholders than is currently possible given existing theory."
224	1999	NVSQ	28:04:00	Electronic Advocacy by Nonprofit Organizations in Social Welfare Policy	"Technology is revolutionizing the practice of political advocacy, a fact that has important ramifications for the nonprofit sector. This exploratory study examines the current application of electronic advocacy techniques in the affiliates of a national social work professional association and considers what factors tend to predict the affiliates that are most successful at adopting these techniques. The study found that all of the affiliates were using some of these technology-based advocacy techniques in their advocacy practice and that the factors that predicted utilization depended on whether affiliates were planning new technology or actually using new technology."
225	1999	NVSQ	28:04:00	Implications of Welfare Reform: Do Nonprofit Survival Strategies Threaten Civil Society?	"Nonprofit organizations play a pivotal role in recent efforts to devolve public responsibilities to lower levels of government and other sectors. The capacity of these organizations to serve as the public safety net, however, has come under question. This multiphase research project focused on the impact of welfare reform on community-based nonprofits in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. The study includes surveys, focus groups, and a case study. Results to date strongly suggest that, in spite of their importance to the welfare reform effort, the capacity of smaller nonprofits to adopt the business-oriented approach required to meet the expectations of government contracts is profoundly limited. This study discusses the implications of these findings for an enduring issue in political theory, the role of nonprofits as schools or laboratories of citizenship, and suggests that the loss of their public character is in danger of going unnoticed."
226	1999	NVSQ	28:04:00	Who Do You Trust? Comparing Data on Skilled-Nursing Facilities from the Internal Revenue Service and Health Care Financing Administration	"This article explores the finances of nonprofit skilled-nursing facilities (SNFs) by comparing two sources of data: Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 990s and Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) cost reports. The result shows that the amounts reported to both agencies for bottom-line figures, such as total assets and liabilities, are consistent. More than 80% (263) of the 412 SNFs examined reported either total liabilities or total assets to the HCFA and the IRS that matched within 10%, nearly 60% (235) reported both variables within 1%. However, as the breakout of the financial data becomes more detailed, more inconsistencies are found. Agreement between sources drops rapidly from more than 80% for total liabilities and assets to below 10% for expenses. This may be due to differences in the way that the IRS and HCFA define financial variables, or it may be because preparers are not knowledgeable or careful enough, or because organizations lack adequate accounting systems that allow for accurate, consistent reporting."
227	1999	NVSQ	28:04:00	"Kathryn S. Keirouz, Robert T. Grimm, Jr., and Richard Steinberg"	"In January 1997, the Indiana University Center on Philanthropy initiated work on a semiannual study of the climate for philanthropic gifts and fund-raising in the United States. This study led to the semiannual publication of the Philanthropic Giving Index (PGI). The PGI measures the climate for philanthropic giving in much the same way that the Consumer Confidence Index assesses the environment for consumer purchases. The PGI focuses on current and expected donor behavior. The authors believe that the PGI will make an important contribution to the field by focusing on current and expected donor behavior. Other available major sources of information on giving focus on past donations, involve significant time lags, and do not attempt to tie donative behavior to solicitation strategies. This research details the methods used to construct the PGI, to select our expert panel, and to form the various subindexes. Next, the potential uses for PGI in research studies is described."
228	2000	NVSQ	29:01:00	Collaborating for Usable Knowledge: A Work in Progress by the Nonprofit Sector Research Fund	"In response to the persistent gap between scholarly research and real world practitioners in the nonprofit sector, the Nonprofit Sector Research Fund (NSRF) of The Aspen Institute launched a series of practitioner-researcher collaborations aimed at producing more usable research. This article provides an overview of NSRF's collaborative programs in the areas of research agenda-setting, grant making, the conduct of research, and dissemination of research findings. It also discusses how NSRF came to adopt this approach, the benefits and challenges presented by collaboration, and ways to overcome these challenges. The authors conclude that despite the difficulties surrounding the collaborative process, collaboration should be attempted in research because it taps the knowledge and experience of both scholars and practitioners to help ensure that research is focused on issues of concern to nonprofit managers and leaders, is methodologically sound, and produces findings that reach appropriate audiences."
229	2000	NVSQ	29:01:00	An Implementation Revolution as a Strategy for Fulfilling the Democratic Promise of University-Community Partnerships: Penn-West Philadelphia as an Experiment in Progress	"In this article, the authors argue that the academic-practitioner divide is largely a product of the Platonic false dualism between superior pure theory and inferior applied practice. The authors call for a Dewey-inspired implementation revolution to build local democratic neighborly communities as a means for advancing academic-practitioner collaboration, fulfilling America's democratic promise, and overcoming the influence of Plato's aristocratic philosophy on American higher education. The authors describe the University of Pennsylvania's Center for Community Partnerships work with public schools as an experiment in progress designed to advance academic-practitioner collaboration and a democratic devolution revolution. Academically based community service learning and research and communal participatory action research are highlighted as particularly useful approaches for improving scholarship and communities and forging democratic, mutually beneficial, and mutually respectful university-school-community partnerships."
230	2000	NVSQ	29:01:00	Lessons Learned from a Practitioner-Academician Collaboration	"The authors, a practitioner and an academician, report on their collaboration over a 4-year period as opportunities arose in which it was important to draw from one author's vast practical experience and the other author's academic expertise. Beginning with a historical view of collaboration grounded in the literature, the authors focus on factors to consider in dealing with collaboration and models of collaboration. After describing three of their collaborative opportunities, they conclude that there are fundamental organizational and institutional issues that need to be considered, even in successful collaborations in which personal and professional differences between the practitioner and academician are not prominent."
231	2000	NVSQ	29:01:00	Transparent Research	"Transparent research is a strategy in which the subjects of ethnographic research are fully involved in designing the research project, collecting the data, and analyzing results. Transparent research is a variety of action research in that inquiry is designed to serve the needs of the people studied. However, it is also scholarly research intended to serve disciplinary goals. An advantage of this approach is that theoretical and practical knowledge gained by practitioners that would not otherwise be known by academic scholars is incorporated into research results. This article develops the idea of transparent research by presenting two case studies. One concerns the emergency medicine department of a medium-sized community hospital. The other concerns a congregational development project, developed in partnership with an Episcopal diocese, and focused on a single congregation."
232	2000	NVSQ	29:01:00	From Research to Social Improvement: Understanding Theories of Intervention	"Social science research can inform the complex and uncertain work of moving toward effective social change on three levels: by describing and analyzing the problems that practitioners confront, by identifying better outcomes for individuals and society, and by illuminating strategies of intervention that practitioners can use to move toward better outcomes. This article offers a conceptual framework for analyzing strategies of intervention, which the author uses to examine U.S. mental health policy between 1948 and 1963. In this case, strong understanding of intervention strategies proved very useful to practitioners attempting to make major social changes in the face of overwhelming obstacles. The example shows that understanding intervention requires different social science tools and ideas than understanding social problems. It also shows that social scientists and practitioners alike may find it valuable to think more systematically about intervention."

Little research has addressed the magnitude and other characteristics of volunteering to state government organizations. This study presents and analyzes the results of the first systematic national survey of volunteering to state government agencies. The study investigates two models, the first to explain volunteer use by state agencies, and the second to explain the realization of benefits from volunteer involvement. Empirical analysis shows that the rate of volunteer involvement in state government is substantial, reaching 36% of the agencies sampled. However, according to the personnel managers surveyed, simply having volunteers is not sufficient. The authors demonstrate that to achieve the full benefits of the approach as perceived by personnel managers, agencies must engage in effective management of their volunteer programs."

The authors seek to remedy this gap by offering and testing the proposition that family firms are more likely to pursue philanthropic involvements. Using a recent typology of family firms, the authors report on the community involvement activities of more than 300 small community hardware stores. Given the small, informal nature of operation and community activity, the authors explore not only their philanthropic activity but also broader community involvement in such areas as business, youth, religious, and service organizations. An interesting trend emerges, firms reporting greater levels of family involvement report greater levels of community involvement than firms identifying themselves as nonfamily enterprises. The authors conclude by reflecting on what this finding suggests for future philanthropy research."

In particular, different strands of theory support the alternative views that nonprofits (a) operate independently as supplements to government, (b) work as complements to government in a partnership relationship, or (c) are engaged in an adversarial relationship of mutual accountability with government. A historical review of the United States revealed that all three views have validity and that government-nonprofit sector relations must be understood as a multilayered phenomenon. In this article, the foregoing analysis is extended internationally. The three theoretical perspectives are applied to four countries: the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, and Japan, in an effort to illuminate nonprofit-government relations in those countries and to assess whether the multilayered approach provides a substantially richer understanding than any one theoretical perspective."

Using personal interviews with Chicago-area foundation officials, this article documents how four types of philanthropic funders approach these decisions. The article shows that the grant process is constrained by how funders obtain their resources and govern themselves. It is also constrained by ongoing relationships between funders and grant recipients, reflecting pervasive task ambiguity and weakly institutionalized norms. The result is a grant award system that resembles a two-stage competitive process."

Kellogg Foundation's Impact Services Model Evolved to Enhance the Management and Social Effects of Large Initiatives	"During the past decade, the W. K. Kellogg Foundation's impact services model has evolved to allow program directors managing large, social change initiatives to draw on the expertise of new team members offering crucial support services. These impact services include social marketing and communications, evaluation, public policy, technology, and organizational learning. Expert consultation in other areas may also be sought as needed by the management team. This article traces the evolution of the impact services model, explores the effects of impact services-supported program management on both the foundation and its grantees, and offers an account of how the model was applied in the case of Families For Kids, a $42 million initiative aimed at stimulating reform in adoption and foster care systems across the nation."

Based on 15 case studies, this article presents a cross-sector collaboration framework consisting of four components. First, the collaboration continuum provides a conceptual framework for categorizing different types of partnerships and studying their possible evolution through three principal stages: philanthropic, transactional, and integrative. Second, the collaboration value construct facilitates the analysis of the definition, creation, balance, and renewal of the value generated in different types of alliances. Third, a set of alliance drivers is identified that determines the nature and functioning of the partnerships. Fourth, alliance enablers that contribute to the effective management of the relationship are set forth. The article discusses the dynamics of the alliance marketplace. The research builds on and extends existing interorganizational research theories by providing a distinctive conceptual framework and new empirical understanding of cross-sector alliances. Future research needs are identified."
239	2000	NVSQ	29:supp 1	Exploring the Effects of Collaborations on Member Organizations: Washington County's Welfare-to-Work Partnership	"Through a case study, this article explores the question of whether and how actions taken by a collaborative alliance influence the strategic behavior of its nonprofit members. The article then assesses how well the existing strategy formulation models accommodate an environment of collaborative alliances. The study finds that this and other local partnerships increased the complexity of the nonprofits decision-making environment, had amplifying and rippling effects on their strategic direction, and changed, to some degree, perceptions of managerial roles. Despite these effects, organization-level strategic planning did not take into account the actions and decisions of these partnerships. The article argues that traditional strategy formulation models often assume a more static and apolitical environment than is the case when collaborative alliances are a significant part of that environment."

In many cases, the partnerships have arisen from the recognition that different activities are best suited to different governance structures. Yet, working through a cross-sectoral partnership can bring with it complicated managerial issues. This article explores partnering in two important sectors: higher education and welfare reform. In both areas, cooperation across the sectors is widespread and follows lines of comparative advantage. At the same time, there is ample evidence in our cases of classic transactions costs in implementing cross-sectoral partnerships. The article explores ways in which organizations deal with problems of opportunism and imperfect information in contracting across the sectors."

After considering how the growing competition from large business firms in this field poses a major challenge to nonprofit organizations, the article suggests that many nonprofits are not well equipped to engage in a narrow efficiency competition with large corporations. Instead, nonprofit human service organizations need to develop a strategy that emphasizes the unique value-driven dimension of their programs. Welfare reform legislation can serve as an opening for both faith-based and secular nonprofits to differentiate themselves and to develop a distinctive position within the government-contracting market. From this analysis, the article draws some broader conclusions about the future of strategy in the nonprofit human services in an increasingly competitive environment."

Organizations were categorized on the basis of their achievement of a balanced budget and targeted funding goals. Based on these criteria, the most successful firms (a) maintained or developed a strong relatedness in program offerings, (b) were financially oriented, with a diverse funding base, and with fund-raising efforts targeting a specific source category for increase, (c) emphasized marketing, and (d) principally sought growth through increased client usage of current offerings. Less successful organizations appeared to lack key strategic management attributes regarding direction or execution."

The most well-developed and commonly relied upon models for developing organizational strategies come from the private sector. Yet, these models fail to take account of two crucially important features of the strategic problem faced by nonprofit organizations and governmental bureaucracies: first, that the value that these organizations produce lies in the achievement of social purposes for which no revenue stream is readily apparent rather than in creating wealth for shareholders or satisfaction to customers, and second, that nonprofit and governmental organizations receive revenues from sources other than customer purchases of products and services. An alternative strategy model developed for use with government organizations focuses the attention of managers on three key issues: public value to be created, sources of legitimacy and support for the organization, and operational capacity to deliver the value. This alternative strategy model seems to resonate powerfully with the experience of nonprofit managers precisely because it focuses attention on social purpose and on the ways in which society as a whole might be mobilized to contribute to social purposes rather than on the financial objectives that can be achieved by selling products and services to markets."

This is based on employees' own internal definition of their employers sector, an approach that it is argued can usefully supplement the dominant external approach. The dimensions along which the (self-defined) third sector emerges as distinctive include its rather small absolute size, its relatively high concentration of part-time and temporary staff, the greater proportion of its workers who work unpaid overtime, the relatively high proportion of employees who are women, the tendency for its respondents to have high levels of educational qualifications, and its distinctive composition. At least some of these features seem to be shared with the third sector in other developed countries, although it is very difficult to be confident in these comparisons for the reasons discussed in the article."

However, questions about the quality of the data continue to be of concern. This study of 350 nonprofit organizations investigates the adequacy, reliability, and appropriate interpretation of IRS 990 Return data through comparisons of selected entries with corresponding measures from each organization's audited financial statements. Both quantitative and qualitative methods are used to examine and explain the consistency between the two data sources. The study concludes that the IRS 990 Return can be considered an adequate and reliable source of financial information for many types of investigations, but preparers and users of the data need a clearer understanding of its purposes to enable appropriate interpretations."
246	2000	NVSQ	29:02:00	Organizational Form and Nursing Home Behavior	"The authors identify differences in performance among for-profit, nonprofit, and government-owned nursing homes in Minnesota. They investigate whether homes of diverse ownership types distribute their surpluses differently, if those differences narrow over time, and if the various ownership types react differently to changes in the regulatory environment. Government-owned and nonprofit homes spend more per resident day for nursing care costs than do independent for-profit homes. Chain affiliation is important in explaining persistent spending differences. There is an agency problem: Nursing homes belonging to chains behave differently from their independent counterparts. Secular non-profits belonging to national chains spend less of their surplus on nursing care costs after regulations allowed more of this form of spending to be recouped in rates charged to the residents. The secular firms affiliated with national chains spend less on nursing care than the control group. As the predicted surpluses of for-profit chains increase, the owners' compensation falls."
247	2000	NVSQ	29:02:00	Agency Theory in the Not-for-Profit Sector: Its Role at Independent Colleges	"Agency theory has long been studied in the corporate setting and used to explain performance in management and in boards of directors. However, little has been done to extend this research into the area of not-for-profits. Using data collected from member institutions of the Council of Independent Colleges, relationships between boards of trustees and presidential demography and institutional performance were examined. Data were analyzed using panel regression with a separate panel for each year's data and for each of the responding schools. Using revenue and gift income as dependent variables, it was found that increases in the size, average tenure, and level of business executive background on a board led to subsequent increases in performance for the institution. Diversity of the board had mixed results, whereas presidential tenure improved performance. These findings partially support the hypotheses and extend the explanatory reach of agency theory into the not-for-profit sector"

The results indicate that nonprofit sectors vary widely in terms of the numbers of organizations in them and the proportions of different types of providers. Moreover, the findings showed complex and intriguing relationships between nonprofit sectors and political culture, generosity, wealth, poverty, and heterogeneity. Traditionalistic sites had sectors with the opposite characteristics. The sectors in individualistic sites lay between these two patterns. Wealthier sites had larger, better-supported and secure sectors. Sites with higher poverty had less well supported sectors with smaller human service components. The most and least heterogeneous sites had the largest and smallest nonprofit sectors respectively. These findings bolster confidence in the use of NCCS data."

Three basic channels of influence are described. The institutions impacted the sponsor's very identity and purpose, they defined the requisites of holy activity, and they served as a channel for membership recruitment and leadership development. Implications for denominations and other religious groups of the current attenuation of ties with their former institutions are then explored."

Results indicate no significant difference between for-profit and nonprofit centers in overall quality or in their tendency to skimp, except in North Carolina with its less stringent licensing requirements. When for-profit and nonprofit sectors are subdivided by ownership, however, for-profit chains and nonprofit centers operated by churches or community agencies produce significantly lower hard-to-observe quality than other nonprofit subsectors. In North Carolina, all for-profits, especially chains, produce lower hard-to-observe quality, suggesting that for-profit firms take advantage of low state licensing standards. These results indicate the importance of subdividing for-profit and nonprofit sectors to gain insight into industry performance, to design effective public policy, and to address the underlying problems of information asymmetry in the industry."

One risk is the potential negative effect of the plan on employees' intrinsic motivation. The authors investigated employee motivation in a study of a nonprofit organization before and after the implementation of a merit pay system. Results suggest that merit pay produced a decline in intrinsic motivation for employees initially highly intrinsically motivated. Justice-related factors also had an effect. Employees who indicated a preference for merit pay and believed that their performance was appraised unfairly experienced a significant decline in intrinsic motivation after the merit pay plan was implemented."

In this article, the authors report partial findings from a growing database across six states, focusing on what is known about the use of volunteers and paid staff complaint investigation. Findings reveal differences in the types of complaints received, the sources of complaints, and the percentage of complex (difficult) complaints investigated by volunteers and paid staff. These differences result in a natural triaging that occurs among volunteers and paid staff, so that complaints viewed as difficult to verify and resolve are automatically given to paid staff."

However, the nondistribution constraint in and of itself may not be sufficient, and nonprofits must actively gain public trust. In particular, charities that are involved in fund-raising from the general public must make an effort to elicit and maintain donor confidence. The author proposes that they do so by a judicious use of signals and discusses the types of signals charities use to establish their trustworthiness to raise funds. Direct mail appeals, used by charities to raise funds from the general public, are examined to verify the signals discussed."

In particular, how do large nonprofits compare in size and rank with for-profit corporations and public organizations in different U.S. cities? Using data obtained from Chambers of Commerce, the U.S. Bureau of the Census, and city business journals, the authors take a step in exploring the relationship of cities to large employing organizations by developing an organizational/sectoral landscape of the 72 major metropolitan areas in the United States. The authors test hypotheses concerning the sectoral types of organizations that dominate the top 10 employers of cities, and the role of regionalism in patterning these observations is explored."

Evidence from Time Diary Data, 1965 to 1993"	"Now that married women are working more for pay than they were three decades ago, are they less likely to volunteer? I use national time diary surveys conducted in 1965, 1975, 1985, and 1993 to document a decrease in the weekly volunteer participation rate of working-age married women, from 16.4% in 1965 to 9.3% in 1993. Changes in observable characteristics explain about 65% of the decrease in married women's volunteer participation from 1965 to 1985. The increased employment rates of married women as well as the changes in their parental status are substantial contributors to the decline in their volunteer participation. Married women's gain in educational attainment is the most important factor to offset the decline in their volunteer participation. However, married women's changing labor force and parental status do not explain why married women's volunteer participation continued to decline from 1985 to 1993."
256	2000	NVSQ	29:04:00	The Racial Wealth Gap: Origins and Implications for Philanthropy in the African American Community	"In this article, the author argues that any consideration of race and formal philanthropic activity must consider the issue of wealth differences, it is in the area of wealth that the greatest degree of racial in equality exists, with Black families owning about one eighth the assets of White families. In addition to this empirical rationale for investigating the role of net worth in accounting for Black-White differences in philanthropic activity, the author provides a theoretical argument, distinguishing between the role of income and that of wealth in giving. The author concludes by arguing for a new research agenda that links the burgeoning literature on race and wealth to that on race and philanthropy."
257	2000	NVSQ	29:04:00	Reframing Social Origins Theory: The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere	"A recent article by Salamon and Anheier proposes a new theoretical approach to explaining patterns of nonprofit development cross-nationally  the social origins approach. Although it focuses on a broader societal and political context, the analysis still seems to rest on the prevailing government-failure approach and a two-sector view of society. Institutional analysis suggests nonprofit organizations should be viewed not as forming an institutional sector but as part of a complex network of organizations linked together in the public sphere. Following an institutional perspective, this contribution develops an alternative conceptual framework for analyzing the structural transformation of the public sphere and the changing role played by nonprofit organizations in this process. It will be shown that at least with respect to Western Europe this conceptual framework gives a more accurate picture of the historical development of welfare regimes and the interdependence of organizations in society than the social origins approach."

This article is part of a large national study that examines the historical evolution of one such organization, the Women's Funding Network (WFN), which is connected to an industry of social change funds. WFN includes over 70 women's funds across the United States and Canada that define fund-raising and fund allocation as a strategy for empowering women and achieving social change. Using the resource mobilization framework of Zald and McCarthy, the author considers critical issues that women's funds have faced since their emergence as a network (1985) dedicated to social movement goals. Examples from case studies, surveys, and participant observation are used to compare individual funds and to analyze the impact of increasing institutionalization on mission, structure, resource mobilization, leadership, and programmatic activities of WFN as a social movement organization."

This report profiles the most salient characteristics of active volunteers. At the national level, the key characteristic that universally sets active volunteers apart from others is their high level of involvement in a variety of other forms of contributing and participating, such as charitable giving, informal volunteering, social activity, and civic participation. They are also likely to have above-average educations and occupations and to have children younger than age 17 in a larger-than-average household. The study also reveals how active volunteers have different patterns of distinctive characteristics in different regions and communities of different size across the country."
260	2001	NVSQ	30:01:00	Wealth and the Commonwealth: New Findings on Wherewithal and Philanthropy	"Drawing in large part on the 1995 Survey of Consumer Finances, the authors describe the pattern of charitable giving by families at the upper reaches of income and wealth, as well as across the income spectrum. The overriding empirical motif is that the distribution of charitable giving is more highly skewed toward the upper end of the financial spectrum than previously documented, and that there appears to be a trend toward becoming even more so. The overriding theoretical motif is that income and wealth are so thoroughly imbricated, especially at the upper end of the financial spectrum, that the analyses of the determinants of charitable giving need to shift from their current focus on the dynamics of income to a complementary focus on the dynamics of wealth."
261	2001	NVSQ	30:01:00	Community Choice between Volunteer and Professional Fire Departments	"This article presents an economic model for community choice between volunteer and professional fire protection services. Using data from the Indiana State Fire Marshal and the 1991 U.S. census, regression techniques were used to estimate the share of county population served by volunteer fire protection from variables measuring community demands for fire protection and relative costs of volunteer and professional departments. The results provide evidence that professional departments are cost-effective at high levels of fire protection and volunteer departments are cost-effective at low levels of fire protection. Per capita income, population density, education, property value, percentage of renters, farm receipts, and the percentage of commuters were found to be significant determinants of fire protection choice."
262	2001	NVSQ	30:01:00	Nonprofit Boards: Crucibles of Expertise or Symbols of Local Identities?	"Nonprofit boards, as boundary spanners, often serve the institutional purpose of affording legitimacy to organizations. Neo-institutional theory suggests that nonprofit organizations, as particularly susceptible to legitimacy demands of changing environments, would tend toward rationalizing internal structures. This article, using historical panel data, explores the extent of one form of rationalization, recruiting trustees with college education and/or professional or managerial occupations. It finds that trustees with college education, managers, and professionals continue to have significant representation on nonprofit boards. Also, many boards are increasingly less exclusive with respect to gender, race, and religion. Some select nonprofit boards, however, continue to be dominated by different gender, racial, and religious identities, suggesting that nonprofit boards also serve the purpose of representing different identity and/or interest groups in the community."
263	2001	NVSQ	30:01:00	Strengthening North-South Partnerships for Sustainable Development	"Although U.S. private voluntary organizations (PVOs) have been working for more than a decade on improving their partnerships with Southern nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), current surveys indicate that there is still a gap between PVO and Southern NGO perceptions of effectiveness. On the basis of a comparative analysis of four case studies of partnership between U.S. PVOs and African NGOs, this article suggests that the remaining barriers to effective partnership are found in the PVOs' internal systems for financial and management control. These systems are more attuned to the demands of accountability, as conceptualized in agency theories, than to the demands of partnership as conceptualized in collaboration theories. This article proposes an integrative concept, collaborative accountability, and recommends a number of proactive and practical change strategies for PVOs that wish to continue to improve their partnerships."

"On the heels of the 1996 Charitable Choice provisions, a variety of welfare reform measures are drawing smaller faith-based groups, especially congregations, into the social service arena. These newcomers face many difficulties as they learn to answer proposal requests and apply for funds. This research analyzes 105 applications for funds, 70 from faith-based groups, presented to the Indianapolis mayor's office. It reports on which religious organizations are applying, the quality of their applications, the applications' religious content, and the relationship between application quality and funding success. The discussion suggests differences between new initiatives meant to create a level playing field for faith-based groups and those meant to encourage their participation, and raises questions about what the data mean for each of these options."

A second part of the theme says that, when the time came, the third sector proved inadequate to the challenges posed by the Great Depression. The authors identify seven themes in 20th-century third sector study that elaborate this basic story: complement, challenge, auxiliary, alternative, apostasy, impediment, and transformation. The authors conclude that the third sector articulates needs, offers assurance and comfort, permits individuals to join in creating the joys of shared community life, and provides opportunities for the greatest and the least in society to make common cause."

The article provides a few examples of the use of long-term statistical series to gain perspective on the contemporary nonprofit sector and of the use of such series in evaluating standard liberal interpretations of American history in general. The historical examples in the article (such as the decline in American generosity since the 1960s) are as much suggestive as definitive but all point to valuable questions to be explored through more detailed studies.
267	2001	NVSQ	30:02:00	Historical Roots of the Nonprofit Sector in France	"Though deeply rooted in the Middle Ages, as in every European Country, the French nonprofit sector differs in that it was secularized and restricted at the beginning of the 19th century by the centralized state. According to a tradition dating back to the 1789 Revolution, the state had the monopoly of public interest concerns. This tradition gradually lost force in the 20th century, and nonprofit organizations multiplied during the past three decades in every field of public interest. This trend was encouraged by the central and local governments in a period of decentralization and European integration. Decentralization offers a great opportunity for the French nonprofit sector, conversely, nonprofit organizations provide collective services in an alternative way and can offer an antidote to latent centralization tendencies."
268	2001	NVSQ	30:02:00	The Growth of the Nonprofit Sector in the Netherlands	"In the past century, the Netherlands' nonprofit sector has grown tremendously. Nowadays, it is one of the largest in the world. This article considers the growth of the sector in general, and pays special attention to its main domains: education, health care, social work, the arts, and culture. It argues that three factors explain the sector's current size. First, the Netherlands has a long and rich tradition of private initiatives, ranging from the medieval guilds and church-related activities to pillarization in the 19th and 20th centuries. Second, the posture of the government created a political environment that stimulated nonprofit growth. Finally, the crucial factor in the expansion of the nonprofit sector is the scheme of collective finance and private provision for key welfare state services. This scheme started in education and later spread to health care and social services."

"The establishment of the British National Health Service in 1948 was a watershed for the nonprofit sector, as the voluntary hospitals were taken into public ownership. This article surveys the voluntary hospitals of London in the last two peacetime decades of their existence. Although this was a period of significant expansion for the hospitals, there were also difficulties looming. City-wide data and records of individual institutions are used to explore the risk of deficit, the hospitals' asset base, the demand for expenditure, and the changing basis of income. The analysis confirms and augments earlier discussion of gathering financial hardship. Finally, the growth of the municipal hospital service is detailed. The London County Council's enthusiastic development of publicly funded institutions added to the problems of the voluntary sector. Public/nonprofit partnership remained underdeveloped, voluntary fundraising was undermined, and principled opposition was articulated by council members."

The author provides a general overview of the human service field, its current size and composition, and the role of nonprofit organizations, examines broad trends in these dimensions and the role of government policies, and reviews why and how these developments constitute significant changes in human services and how they compare with those in other fields. The article concludes with a look at the future role of nonprofit organizations in human services and at major developments in the funding and management of nonprofit human service organizations."

Even before the passage of federal, state, and local fair housing laws, groups of concerned citizens gathered together to improve opportunities for equal housing choice. Fair housing councils (FHCs) cropped up across the country as the Civil Rights movement expanded throughout the nation. As a part of then on profit quiet revolution, some FHCs have come across a new way to affirmatively further fair housing with much reduced government subsidies. This article explores the successes (and failures) of fair housing advocacy nonprofits that have sought compensatory and punitive damages through the courts for frustration of their missions and diversion of their resources. Some of these groups have moved from dependency on federal, state, and local government funds to reliance on court orders and civil settlements, whereby fair housing scofflaws pay for their transgressions by funding the work of these advocacy organizations."
272	2001	NVSQ	30:02:00	Understanding the Mobilization of Professionals	"This article develops a Professional Mobilization Framework to guide research and discussion of the mobilization of nonprofit professionals in issue politics. We use the framework, together with literature on women clergy, to develop expectations about the issue interests and political mobilization of women clergy. We use qualitative interview data and aggregate survey data from 54 women clergy to test the expectations developed in the framework. The results of the study show that the women's issue agendas focus on racism and intolerance, poverty, and gay rights, while their action agendas stress poverty, community organizing, and reproductive rights. Organizational mobilization and ease of entry appear to push women clergy into far more poverty and community-organizing activities than would be expected based on their interest in these issues alone. Meanwhile, organizational demobilization appears to result in less activity than interest on issues such as gay rights, women's rights, and racism."

A MANOVA was used to analyze the effect of organizational type of which there were four categories (publicly oriented nonprofits, mutual nonprofits, cooperatives without shares, and cooperatives with shares) on the five dependent measures (social objectives, volunteer participation, democratic decision making, government dependence, and market reliance) derived from the social economy framework. The results offer some support for the hypothesis that serving a membership is an important factor in the basic characteristics of an organization, and that is true regardless of whether the incorporation is nonprofit or cooperative. However, charitable status also appeared to influence on the results. The implications for the social economy and civil society are discussed."

An early contribution to this literature was Tuckman and Chang's elaboration of four financial ratios that they believe could be used to predict financial vulnerability. These measures have largely escaped empirical tests. This research note describes a test of the Tuckman-Chang financial vulnerability measures among a population of nonprofit arts organizations. The article concludes that although the Tuckman-Chang measures do not have utility for all types of arts nonprofits, the measures nonetheless show substantial promise for predicting the closure of some nonprofit organizations."

"This article explores a series of issues the Northwest Area Foundation has considered as part of its strategic planning process. The Foundation engaged in intensive strategic planning from 1996 to 1998 and has continued to focus on strategic alignment since that time. This has led to major changes in how the foundation is governed, does its work, and identifies its potential partners."

Other theorists argue that environmental constraints and conditioned responses to positive or negative reinforcement of earlier behaviors are better predictors of subsequent behaviors than initial goals. In this study, the relationship of initial goals to subsequent service outcomes, satisfaction, and intention to volunteer was empirically investigated. Among a sample of 362 AmeriCorps members, the goals that stipended volunteers brought to their service were found to influence outcomes related to those goals 1 year later. Self-esteem was an important moderator of the relationship between goals and outcomes. The overall match of goal importance to goal achievement predicted both satisfaction and likelihood of future volunteering. The results have implications for research on volunteers and volunteer management."
277	2001	NVSQ	30:03:00	Who is Being Served? The Impact of Student Volunteering on Local Community Organizations	"This research investigated how local community-based and nonprofit organizations benefit from cooperation with community-based learning (CBL) initiatives such as service learning, internships, and volunteering. By examining data from local organizations that cooperate with a campus-based student volunteer program, the authors empirically assessed the extent to which local organizations benefit from cooperation with CBL initiatives. The data enabled comparisons of the relative contributions of university student volunteers and off-campus volunteers recruited from the larger community. The authors found that student volunteers constitute a substantial pool of volunteer labor for local organizations, yet they play different roles than community volunteers, roles that vary by organizational form. Student volunteers are generally the least likely to provide or help plan and coordinate services compared with community volunteers. These differences can be offset by a modest amount of training for student volunteers. The findings do not support the notion that students are used exclusively for routine tasks"
278	2001	NVSQ	30:03:00	A Decade of Service-Related Research: A Map of the Field	"The 1990s ushered in a new era for service as a problem-solving strategy, with a concomitant expansion in the service-related literature. The authors report the results of a bibliographic survey of the literature that assessed the contents of more than 2,500 abstracts. Service-related research has diffused to a wide array of disciplines and policy fields. However, the common interest across disciplines has not translated into a more coherent understanding of service. The most recent research is fragmented across disciplines and outcomes. In addition, much of the most recent research diverges from traditional definitions of volunteerism. Few attempts have been made to synthesize the latest wave of research results and integrate them with previous research and theory. Recommendations are offered to increase convergence among investigators and improve the quality of service-related research."
279	2001	NVSQ	30:03:00	Challenges in Survey Research and Their Implications for Philanthropic Studies Research	"The authors review many of the serious challenges faced by survey researchers whose craft is to design and implement survey research. The challenges differ by mode of data collection (in person, telephone, mail, Web, etc.), and they have strong implications for philanthropy researchers who use survey research. Specialists in survey research have benefited from a number of developments in question and questionnaire design, sampling, cost containment, and handling increasing nonresponse. After reviewing these developments, the authors conclude with a plea to researchers to consult survey research experts at all points in survey design and planning. This will result in better data and research."
280	2001	NVSQ	30:03:00	Evaluation of Differences in Giving and Volunteering Data Collected by In-Home and Telephone Interviewing	"While preparing for its 1999 study, Giving and Volunteering in the United States, Independent Sector was told by its contractor that starting in 2000, it could no longer conduct the survey using in-home interviews. Independent Sector contracted with another company to do a parallel study in 1999 by telephone to identify issues related to changing the survey mode. The results showed highly statistically significant differences on many of the major questions, raising questions as to whether the differences were mainly due to between-company or between-collection modalities. Another company was then commissioned to do both an in-home study and a telephone study in two cities in New England. With similar training for all interviewers, better sampling methods, prior letters to potential respondents, incentives, and multiple follow-ups, the results showed no significant differences between modes on any of the major questions."
281	2001	NVSQ	30:03:00	Research on Giving and Volunteering: Methodological Considerations	"A 1998-1999 survey of the giving and volunteering practices of 3,616 adult Californians yielded some methodological considerations concerning research on charitable behavior. The survey paid particular attention to prompting respondent recall, informal giving and volunteering, and possible race/ethnicity differences in charitable behavior. On several key measures, reported levels of giving and volunteering exceeded national estimates based on Independent Sector studies. Californians were found to engage extensively in informal as well as formal charitable behavior. Multivariate analysis controlling for income, educational attainment, and immigration status revealed no significant race/ethnicity-based differences in giving and volunteering."

This article discusses the challenges associated with designing giving and volunteering surveys, suggests strategies for improving measures of giving and volunteering, and shows how they were applied in the design of Canada's 1997 National Survey of Giving, Volunteering and Participating."
283	2001	NVSQ	30:03:00	The Methods and Metrics of the Boston Area Diary Study	"The authors discuss the conceptual framework, methods, and findings of the Boston Area Diary Study (BADS) to provide insights into the problems and prospects of survey research on philanthropy. First, the conceptual foundations and the operationalization of the variables are discussed. Next, the research design and methodology are described, and the findings are briefly summarized. Next, two validity measures are presented: a comparison of the BADS results with those subsequently obtained by The Gallup Organization from interviews with the same participants and a study of possible Hawthorne effects produced by repeated interviewing. Next, some specific recommendations are made for the operationalization and measurement of giving and volunteering and for improvements to field procedures. In the conclusion, the authors reflect on the implications of careful research methodology for an adequate assessment of the range and level of care in society."
284	2001	NVSQ	30:03:00	A Methodological Comparison of Giving Surveys: Indiana as a Test Case	"Every 4 years, the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University conducts a telephone survey (called Indiana Gives) of the giving and volunteering behaviors of Indiana citizens. In preparing to conduct Indiana Gives for 2000, a larger methodological question was asked: How much does survey methodology matter in generating accurate measures of giving and volunteering? In this most recent wave of the Indiana survey, conducted in October and November 2000, eight groups of approximately 100 randomly selected Indiana residents were asked to complete one of eight surveys related to giving and volunteering. It was found that the longer the module and the more detailed its prompts, the more likely a household was to recall making any charitable contribution and the higher the average level of its giving. These differences persisted even after controlling for differences in age, educational attainment, income, household status, race, and gender."

This article focuses on developing the concept of INGO accountability, first as an abstract concept and then as a strategic idea with very different implications for different INGO strategies. The authors examine implications for INGOs that emphasize service delivery, capacity building, and policy influence. They propose that INGOs committed to service delivery may owe more accountability to donors and service regulators, capacity-building INGOs may be particularly obligated to clients whose capacities are being enhanced, and policy influence INGOs may be especially accountable to political constituencies and influence targets. INGOs that are expanding their activities to include new initiatives may need to reorganize their accountability systems to implement their strategies effectively."

"This article draws attention to the importance of public goods for the well-being of people, including, as a means toward this end, for the efficiency of markets. The author suggests that as a result of globalization, a growing number of public goods have assumed cross-border dimensions and become global public goods (GPGs). They can no longer be adequately provided through domestic policy action alone but require international cooperation for their adequate provision. The author argues that for globalization to work for all, it is important for civil society organizations (CSOs) to become more systematically involved in international negotiations and cooperation and to facilitate closer linkages between domestic policy making and international cooperation. Six policy options are discussed that could strengthen the role of CSOs in the provision of GPGs and in achieving more balanced and sustainable development."
287	2001	NVSQ	30:03:00	Reaching beyond the Family: New Nongovernmental Organization Alliances for Global Poverty Alleviation and Emergency Response	"In the past two decades, failed states, the end of the cold war, and the rise of ethnic identity movements have spawned civil wars and humanitarian disasters. Global economic changes have generated new economic disparities and spawned additional forms of poverty in both the developing and the developed worlds. These profound changes raise new issues about the role of the not-for-profit sector in a world where state resources for human services have eroded. The purpose of this article is to identify several new patterns of engagement by international relief and development nongovernmental organizations (NGOs): experimental partnerships with the private sector and new multidirectional, global NGO alliances and networks for both operational response and advocacy."
288	2001	NVSQ	30:03:00	Vertically Integrated Policy Monitoring: A Tool for Civil Society Policy Advocacy	"Effective independent civil society monitoring of public policy processes requires vertical integration to monitor different elite actors simultaneously. Vertical integration refers here to the coordination of policy monitoring and public interest advocacy efforts across different levels of the policy process, from the local to the national and transnational arenas. Systematic, coordinated monitoring of the performance of all levels of public decision making can reveal more clearly where the main problems are, permitting more precisely targeted civil society advocacy strategies. Because policy makers' information about actual institutional performance is very limited, rarely field based, and drawn mainly from interested parties (especially in the case of large-scale, decentralized social programs), the resulting information gap creates opportunities for advocacy groups to use independent monitoring to gain credibility and leverage. This article, written originally for a Mexican activist audience, explores the implications of this approach in the context of civil society efforts to monitor and influence World Bank projects."

The authors use data from the 1998 National Congregations Study to provide a portrait of congregations' social service activities, emphasizing features of this portrait that are relevant to ongoing policy debates. In particular, they assess two claims often made about religiously based social services: Religious organizations represent an alternative to secular or government organizations by providing holistic and personalistic services focused on long-term solutions to individuals' problems, and collaborations with secular, especially government, organizations threaten to undermine that approach to social services. Results support neither of these claims. Congregation-based social services are not an alternative to the world of secular nonprofit or government-supported social services, they are part of that world."
290	2001	NVSQ	30:04:00	Community Variations in the Size and Scope of the Nonprofit Sector: Theory and Preliminary Findings	"Nonprofits reflect and shape community conditions. Understanding the nature of this relationship is important if we are to fully comprehend the role nonprofits play in contemporary society and if policy makers are to make effective use of the sector to implement local responses to community needs. Using data on Internal Revenue Service registered nonprofits for Indian counties, the authors examine how theories of demand, supply, and social structure predict the overall density of nonprofits in local communities. The authors find substantial county-level variations in the densities of nonprofits overall and of charitable, advocacy, and mutual-benefit nonprofits. Using multiple regression techniques, they are able to explain 20% to 46% of overall variation (depending on legal category involved) in nonprofit densities. Their findings support the supply and social structure, but not demand, explanations and reveal somewhat divergent patterns for the various types of nonprofits. The authors note several important caveats to the findings."
291	2001	NVSQ	30:04:00	Legitimation Issues in the State-Nonprofit Relationship	"Current theories on the origin of the nonprofit sector do not adequately explain changes in the relative scale of social welfare service provision by the state versus private nonprofit entities. French and Japanese experiences illustrate that nations can undergo significant change, cycling through periods of expansion then restriction of the legal status and role of the nonprofit sector. This article considers the potential for legitimation strategies to explain the shifts in nonprofit status in France and Japan. The article concludes that although some theoretical foundation exists on legitimation concepts, additional work needs to be done to derive a sufficient theory of how legitimation issues affect change in the nonprofit sector."

The data tell an interesting story regarding perceptions of community service program experiences among students from different racial/ethnic backgrounds and schools with different class and racial/ethnic characteristics. Findings from the quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal important similarities and differences among race/ethnic groups in their community service experiences that have direct theoretical, policy, and practical implications."
293	2001	NVSQ	30:04:00	The Place of Self and Reflexivity in Third Sector Scholarship: An Exploration	"This article draws attention to two significant strands in the development of contemporary social science scholarship: the recognition of the importance of self in research processes and the recognition of the reflexive nature of knowledge construction. It argues that these two strands should be taken more seriously by nonprofit and voluntary sector scholars. A family history case study is presented: the outcome of the author's own research into the ways in which the lives of her parents and grandparents, as well as her own life, have been affected by nonprofit and voluntary organizations. The author considers how this has affected her own academic work in the nonprofit and voluntary sector field. The article concludes with a discussion of what, in the light of the case study, social science thinking on reflexivity and on the place of self in research might contribute to third sector scholarship in the future."
294	2001	NVSQ	30:04:00	"The Civic Core in Canada: Disproportionality in Charitable Giving, Volunteering, and Civic Participation"	"Three principal modes of civic involvement are volunteering, giving to charities, and participating in civic associations. The authors investigate how total effort is distributed in the Canadian population among these three behaviors. Their results show that in each area, there is a small group of individuals who is responsible for the majority of contributory effort. When activity in the three areas is considered all together, the authors find a remarkably high degree of concentration. Six percent of Canadian adults account for 35% to 42% of all civic involvement. This group of individuals represents the civic core in Canada. The implications of the existence of a small but dedicated civic core for the voluntary domain and for patterns of citizen engagement are discussed."
295	2001	NVSQ	30:04:00	Introducing the Nonprofit Program Classification System: The Taxonomy We've Been Waiting for	"The National Center for Charitable Statistics at the Urban Institute has developed a system to classify the programs, services, and activities of public charities, called the Nonprofit Program Classification (NPC) System. Designed to serve a wide range of potential users, the system has been used to code the activities of each organization, as reported in Part IIIProgram Service Accomplishments of its Form 990. Currently, codes from the National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE) system are used to classify nonprofit organizations according to their organizational purpose. Frequently, however, the questions that are asked by researchers, nonprofit organizations, and the public are focused on what an organization does rather than the type of organization. This article describes the development of the system and its strengths and limitations. Using both the NPC and NTEE systems, researchers will be able to develop a more complete portrait of nonprofit organizations and their activities."
296	2002	NVSQ	31:01:00	Negotiating Accountability: Managerial Lessons from Identity-Based Nonprofit Organizations	"This article explores the emerging conceptualization of accountability in nonprofit organizations. This definition broadens traditional concerns with finances, internal controls, and regulatory compliance. The authors explore how the top-level managers of 4 identity based nonprofit organizations (IBNPs) faced accountability and responsiveness challenges to accomplish their mission. The organization-community link was the core relationship in their accountability environment, helping the IBNP managers achieve what the literature calls negotiated accountability. The managers favored organizational mechanisms to sustain this relationship in the midst of the accountability demands they experienced daily. Communication with the primary constituency tended to drive the organization's priorities and programs, helped managers find legitimate negotiation tools with other stakeholders, and helped develop a broader notion of accountability. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for other nonprofit organizations and propose questions to further clarify the concepts of broad accountability, negotiated accountability, and the link between accountability and responsiveness in nonprofits."
297	2002	NVSQ	31:01:00	"Does Participation in Voluntary Associations Contribute to Social Capital? The Impact of Intensity, Scope, and Type"	"Voluntary associations are often ascribed a fundamental role in the formation of social capital. However, scholars disagree on the extent to which face-to-face contact, that is, active participation, is necessary to create this resource. This article examines the impact of participation in associations on social capital using three dimensions: intensity (active vs. passive participation), scope (many vs. few affiliations) and type (nonpolitical vs. political purpose). Whereas those affiliated display higher levels of social capital than outsiders, the difference between active and passive members is absent or negligible. The only cumulative effect of participation occurs when a member belongs to several associations simultaneously, preferably with different purposes. The article challenges the notion that active participation is necessary for the formation of social capital and suggests that more attention should be paid to the importance of passive and multiple affiliations within associations."
298	2002	NVSQ	31:01:00	Development of Trust in Rural Nonprofit Collaborations	"Development of trust among organization leaders and staff is important to the formation of successful organizational collaborations. Nonprofit leaders in two rural regions of southern Illinois and the Mississippi Delta demonstrate an awareness of the importance of trust among participants in the collaborations they engage in. Several environmental factors both encourage and constrain the ability of nonprofits in the two regions to form collaborations and build trust among partners. One of these, rural location, is largely considered a positive influence, making it easier for nonprofit leaders to get to know each other and work cooperatively. In addition, other factors such as race relations, government policies and mandates, nonprofit leadership, and organization financial and political resources have powerful effects on creation of collaborations and development of trust"
299	2002	NVSQ	31:01:00	Information Struggles: The Role of Information in the Reproduction of NGO-Funder Relationships	"This article examines struggles over information between two nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in India and their key international funders. The author outlines both the strategies used by international funders to increase their control over information generation within NGOs and the strategies used by the case NGOs to resist these interventions. Three main arguments are advanced: (a) The information requirements of funders affect NGOs not only by placing demands on their attention but also by promoting positivist and easily quantifiable valuations of success and failure, this is not an intended effect but a systemic one, (b) NGOs resist funder attempts to structure their behavior through a series of strategies that include the symbolic generation of information, selective sharing of information, and the strategic use of professionals to enhance legitimacy, and, (c) this combination of funder demands for information and NGO resistance to external interference serves to entrench existing information systems, thereby reproducing tensions between NGOs and funders."
300	2002	NVSQ	31:01:00	Organizational Capacity and Organizational Effectiveness among Street-Level Food Assistance Programs	"Organizational capacity is a critical issue for street-level charitable organizations, such as food pantries and soup kitchens, which are increasingly involved as partners with government in the provision of social services. Capacity refers to a set of attributes assumed in the literature to bear on organizational effectiveness. This survey of food programs in the Detroit metropolitan area not only attempts to develop a capacity profile, but it empirically seeks to link the notion of capacity to effectiveness, that is, to mission fulfillment. The key attributes of organizational capacity that bear on mission fulfillment among this sample of organizations are the presence of a paid staff person and computerization of records. Institutionalization and seeking technical assistance from other organizations, other aspects of capacity, seem to do little to increase organizational effectiveness."

As this burgeoning movement emerges from its infancy stages, numerous questions about assessing and funding these efforts arise. The author relies on his experiences as a participant observer, evaluator, and researcher to address the following questions: What are effective measurements of progress in higher education community partnerships? What is the significance of this movement's stage in development regarding the availability of resources and the appropriateness of assessment? The author also relies on his observations of the field of corporate social responsibility to see if it sheds any light on how one should think about resources and assessment of higher education-community partnerships. Although measurable outcomes of these efforts are essential, process is a major factor, given the significance of relationships to success. For example, if trust and communication do not exist between partners, effective outcomes will remain elusive."
302	2002	NVSQ	31:02:00	Collaborative Windows and Organizational Governance: Exploring the Formation and Demise of Social Service Partnerships	"For collaboratives to form, this article argues that a collaborative window (the confluence of problem, policy, organizational, and social/political/economic streams) must open, and a collaborative entrepreneur must act (recognizing the window and bringing together appropriate partners). This article argues that because collaborations form in response to particular collaborative windows, the initial governance structures developed will correspond to the conditions characterizing the window. Because initial governance structures are difficult to change and the conditions that characterized the collaborative window shift when the window closes, social service partnerships have built into them the seeds for their short-term demise. To illustrate this argument, a case study is presented of three small, community-based organizations that partnered to provide social services for persons living with HIV and AIDS in Orange County, California. The implications of this case study for understanding the potential long-term impacts of collaborations are discussed."
303	2002	NVSQ	31:02:00	Organizational Innovation in Victorian Social Housing	"Different organizational forms may be developed at different points in time to meet societies social welfare goals. This article considers how we can understand and explain change in the range of institutions chosen to address the problem of the London slums between 1840and1914.A number of theories, which posit some periodization or sequencing in the evolution of nonprofit, public, and for-profit provision, are examined and compared with this historical example. Theories that are implicitly periodized yet not properly historicized cannot account adequately for the process of change in the choice of organizational types to meet society's social welfare goals. For the nonprofit field to learn from history, we must first understand the causal processes that lie behind that history and the factors that explain change as a process of continuity in particular contexts rather than as an abrupt transfer from one unspecified time period to the next."
304	2002	NVSQ	31:02:00	Beyond Charitable Choice: The Diverse Service Delivery Approaches of Local Faith-Related Organizations	"Charitable choice has focused policy attention on the oft-neglected universe of faith related organizations but not necessarily on the corners of that universe that ought to matter most or the questions that are most important. We compare local welfare reform initiatives of eight faith-related organizations to suggest how the debate might be constructively reframed. The evidence (a) argues for putting less focus on congregations as contractors and more attention to their role as sites and resources for church-based coalitions and organizing networks, (b) contradicts a simplified understanding of faith related organizations as agents for instilling virtues and character in the poor, recognizing that many give equal or greater weight to convincing congregations to fulfill their social obligations, and (c) counters the view that the key challenges are legal or regulatory, instead drawing attention to the difficult local work of integrating the resources of faith-related organizations with other public, private, and voluntary organizations."
305	2002	NVSQ	31:02:00	Support Organizations and the Evolution of the NGO Sector	"This article focuses on the emergence of support organizations that play strategic roles in the evolution of development nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) as a sector of civil society. We begin with a discussion of sector challenges from outside (such as public legitimacy, relations with governments, relations with businesses, and relations with international actors) and from inside (amateurism, restricted focus, material scarcity, fragmentation, and paternalism). We describe the rise of agencies to serve critical support functions, such as strengthening individual and organizational capacities, mobilizing material resources, providing information and intellectual resources, building alliances for mutual support, and building bridges across sectoral differences. Then, we examine how those organizations have solved critical problems for NGO communities, and we develop some propositions about the creation and establishment of support organizations, their strategic position, the choice to take strategic action, and how external assistance can support their strategic roles."

At an aggregate level, we know the number and types of programs available for students interested in pursuing advanced degrees in nonprofit management, but we know little about the students who attend these programs and why they chose these programs. To learn more about who these students are and why they choose nonprofit management programs, a survey was conducted in spring and summer 2000 of nonprofit management students enrolled in graduate or certificate programs at six universities across the United States. Results describe the demographic profile of these students, the reasons they sought academic training, and the characteristics they considered important when choosing a nonprofit management education program."
307	2002	NVSQ	31:03:00	The Governance of NGOs in China since 1978: How Much Autonomy?	"Does the surge of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in China indicate a shift in power away from the party-state and the emergence of a civil society? In an attempt to shed light on the relationship between the state and the NGOs, this article examines the aims of official NGO policy and its influence on the growth patterns of NGOs. The discussion is divided into three sections. The first section analyzes the NGO concept in China and the features of official policy. The second and third sections address two models of Chinese NGOs. The study concludes that even as the Chinese government remains the most decisive component in the development of NGOs, the state is withdrawing from responsibilities toward society. The interactive and mutually dependent relations between the government and NGOs indicate the continuing power of the party-state as well as the decline in its capacity to control the growth of organizations."
308	2002	NVSQ	31:03:00	Working amid Corporatism and Confusion: Foreign NGOs in China	"Foreign nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) face impediments in the People's Republic of China. Many such problems result from the NGOs' lack of stable connections to the government. Academic literature on China is rich with data about links between the state and indigenous civil organizations, but relations between the government and foreign development NGOs have received less coverage in public. This article bypasses the widely accepted view of the Chinese state as solely corporatist. It describes Chinese regulation of foreign assistants in development and then offers two case studies of recently established NGOs. It concludes that, rather than demonizing the government for its faults in other areas, foreign development workers in China should be willing to work with government structures whenever possible. Only by understanding the political climate and regulatory structure, as well as the available options, can foreign NGOs hope to establish a long-term presence in China and effect lasting change."
309	2002	NVSQ	31:03:00	The Commercialization of Voluntary Sport Organizations in Norway	"Following a theoretical analysis of factors that may account for the level of commercialization of voluntary sports organizations, commercialization is measured using cross-sectional data at the organizational level. The potential crowding-out effect between (a) commercial resources and (b) public and voluntary resources is investigated. The findings show that the level of commercialization in this sphere is already significant, although dependent on the definition of commercialization. The most commercialized organizations are those that are particularly oriented toward competitions and most dedicated to team sports. The empirical analysis supports the theoretical approach. The greater the facility by which the sport may be transformed into a private good, the more likely it is that the organization will be commercialized. Finally, commercialization does not hinder public sector support nor voluntary work, the most commercialized organizations are also those receiving the largest share of public funds, and increasing commercial resources does not reduce the level of voluntary work."
310	2002	NVSQ	31:03:00	The Emergence of Hybrid Organizational Forms: Combining Identity-Based Service Provision and Political Action	"After the 1960s, women, Blacks, and other ethnic groups mapped political objectives onto a more traditional form of voluntary association, along with investing in direct political protest and advocacy for civil and social rights. One result was the development of a hybrid organizational form that combines advocacy and service provision as its core identity and thus faces distinctive environmental uncertainties and boundary conditions. This article provides a community ecology framework for analyzing the development of the service/advocacy organizational form. The author argues that hybrid forms of organization, by expanding the resource infrastructure and legitimacy available to identity-based organizations, play a critical role in anchoring the continued viability of identity-based service organizations under newly politicized conditions. Data are drawn from a study of national women's and racial and ethnic minority organizations since 1955."
311	2002	NVSQ	31:03:00	Advocacy by UK-Based Development NGOs	"With Northern development nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) becoming more involved in advocacy and policy influence, they are increasingly being asked questions about their effectiveness, legitimacy, accountability, and governance. In an effort to contribute to these debates and to inform NGOs' thinking, this article provides an overview of the advocacy activities of UK-based NGOs. Using material from a recently completed research project, this study examines the growth of UK NGOs' advocacy, the ways in which NGOs actually do advocacy, the position of advocacy within NGOs, the efforts of NGOs to work together in advocacy in the face of pressures to differentiate themselves, the ways in which NGOs relate to donors, issues of legitimacy, representation, and accountability, and evaluation."

One potentially important piece to the NGDO impact puzzle, yet to be addressed in the literature, is the so-called community economic impact, defined here as the direct and induced impact of the NGDO on local economic activity. This article demonstrates how a community economic impact might be estimated using a program of Project Hopean international health care NGDO in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Integral to estimating a community economic impact is the calculation of the relevant regional income multiplier. This article also demonstrates how a regional income multiplier might be estimated for Santo Domingo using the minimum requirements approach developed by Ullman and Dacey. It is hoped that this article will encourage and help other researchers incorporate community economic impact into future analyses of NGDO programs."

Qualitative fieldwork is drawn upon to examine how syringe exchange programs in New York City manage to operate despite government hostility and the disenfranchisement of drug users from policy making. This work examines the presentation of forms chosen by the groups in question, their political machinations and interorganizational relations, and the manner of claims made or not made by representatives of exchange programs in the political arena. Programs are found to have altered their outward appearance and forms away from the needs of their constituents toward protection of state interests, but they have not received very much in return."

Every 4 years, the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University conducts a telephone survey (called Indiana Gives) of the giving and volunteering behaviors of Indiana citizens. In this most recent wave of the Indiana survey, conducted in October and November 2000, we asked eight groups of approximately 100 randomly selected Indiana residents to complete one of eight surveys related to giving and volunteering. We found that the longer and more detailed the module, the more likely an individual was to have provided volunteer service in the past year, and the higher the average number of hours provided, even after controlling for differences in age, income, household status, itemization status, and race. Further research is needed to ascertain whether there may be a point of diminishing returns in terms of optimal survey length and detail and whether recall is inhibited for high-end volunteers only."

New organizations influence public policy. The early years of a new organization are a time of imprinting, as well as vulnerability. The concept of the liability of newness has influenced organizational research, but its dimensions have not been explored fully. This article reviews past research and presents descriptive data on the experiences of newly founded HIV/AIDS organizations. The fate of new AIDS organizations was highly dependent on their acquisition of stable funding sources, particularly public funds. Internal organizational problems had a limited impact on the deaths of organizations, especially those with public funds. Although new organizations face hazards, there are also common dilemmas at other stages in the life cycle that can be traced to nonprofit organizations dependence on multiple funding sources"
316	2002	NVSQ	31:04:00	Testing the Conventional Wisdom Regarding Volunteer Programs: A Longitudinal Analysis of the Service Corps of Retired Executives and the U.S. Small Business Administration	"Conventional wisdom holds that volunteer programs save money and raise the level of services provided by an organization but threaten paid positions. This study tests these assumptions qualitatively and quantitatively based on the experience of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) and its volunteer program, the Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE). The authors examined the SBA's history with SCORE using interviews, records, and reports and then applied interrupted time-series statistical analysis to 42 years of budget, employment, and output data. The authors found evidence that SBA services increased with SCORE but found no support for stereotypes of adversarial relationships between volunteers and paid staff, volunteer replacement of paid personnel, or cutbacks in agency budget to compensate for the addition of an unpaid workforce. This study has broad implications for both public agencies and nonprofit organizations, sounding a cautionary note that conventional assumptions regarding the impact of volunteers on budget and paid staff may need to be reevaluated."
317	2002	NVSQ	31:04:00	A Regression Model Explaining Predisposition to Collaborate	"Using a sample of 645 nonprofit organizations in Canada, the authors construct and validate a regression model to explain predisposition to collaborate. Organizational factors such as size and type (feminist or not) were found to be related to the extent of formal collaborative activity. However, the strength of these factors as predictors of behavior was amplified or reduced by the intervening perception of the impact of environmental changes. In addition, the perception of these pressures was shown to intensify the motivation to collaborate, which in turn increases the probability of engaging in formal interorganizational activity. This study contributes to the body of knowledge about collaboration because previous research has not investigated the influence of a combination of factors on collaborative behavior."
318	2002	NVSQ	31:04:00	Extent and Nature of Overlap between Listings of IRS Tax-Exempt Registration and Nonprofit Incorporation: The Case of Indiana	"To consider the capacity of nonprofits and communities that respond to public policy initiatives, the authors use a comprehensive database of Indiana nonprofits to examine two indicators of nonprofit formalization: tax-exempt registration under Section 501(c) of the IRS code and formal incorporation with the Indiana Secretary of State. The authors find that only 23% of the 54,108 nonprofits in the statewide database meet both criteria for formalization. The authors test whether more formalized nonprofits (appearing on both lists) are larger, older, and active in more institutionalized fields than those on only one or neither of the two lists. The findings generally confirm these expectations. The authors also hypothesize that larger, growing, and more institutionally developed communities will have a more formalized nonprofit sector (greater list overlap). However, few community-level variables relate meaningfully to the measure of sector formalization. Other factors that may be relevant for such an analysis are considered."
319	2003	NVSQ	32:01:00	Information Technology and the Voluntary Sector Workplace	"There is little debate over whether technological change affects work processes and tasks. Yet, exactly how this happens is not at all clear. This study asks the question: How have information technologies changed the nature and distribution of work and workplace relationships in voluntary sector organizations? The authors conducted in-depth, semistructured interviews with 23 respondents in three nonprofit agencies in the capital region of New York State that had an extensive history of involvement in contracting relationships with multiple government bureaucracies. The results indicate that the autonomy and flexibility associated with much of the work performed by the nonprofit labor force influence how information technology affects workplace processes and relationships. Employees with widely varying backgrounds fill newly defined IT jobs. Job satisfaction, workload, and the distribution of power have been altered in a number of complex ways. Responses regarding technology and the relationship between nonprofits and government are also explored."
320	2003	NVSQ	32:01:00	"In Search of Legitimacy: Peace Grant Making of U.S. Philanthropic Foundations, 1988-1996"	"This analysis of peace grant making of U.S. foundations in 1988-1996 is guided by neoinstitutional organizational theory. The author argues that legitimacy concerns underlie the choices foundations make regarding the organizations and causes they fund. Academic and elite recipients give legitimacy to foundations and draw most of the latter's support. Foundations' authority in conferring legitimacy is prominent vis-ö-vis non-elite organizations, which often seek to mobilize foundation support but receive much less of it than elite grantees do. The overall size of peace grant making was very small in the examined period and declined in constant dollars from 1988 to 1996. The author suggests that foundations were disinclined to fund peace due to normative pressure from the national security state. Future research should advance theories about sources of external influence on foundations, paying particular attention to the state's capacity to shape organizational behavior of foundations and of the nonprofit sector generally."
321	2003	NVSQ	32:01:00	Participation in Voluntary Associations and Value Indicators: The Effect of Current and Previous Participation Experiences	"Although most of the literature on social capital argues that voluntary associations are of crucial importance for the establishment of a democratic political culture, empirical research usually reveals but a weak effect of membership on democratic attitudes. This article investigates the possibility that this weak relation might be the result of an inadequate measurement of participation. In testing this hypothesis, the author relies on the results of a face-to-face survey that proved to be representative for the Dutch-speaking population of Belgium. Previous memberships are shown to have strong effects on civic attitudes and feelings of political empowerment. This would imply that a full measurement of participation should not be limited to current membership status but should also include the entire participation history of the respondent."
322	2003	NVSQ	32:01:00	The Intrametropolitan Geography of Poverty and the Nonprofit Sector in Southern California	"This article investigates the geographic distribution of nonprofit social service providers across southern California cities in an attempt to see whether they reach people in poverty. Using 1996 Internal Revenue Service data from the National Center on Charitable Statistics, combined with 1990 census data, the authors find that the number of antipoverty nonprofits and their level of expenditure are higher in poorer cities. Nevertheless, given poverty concentration patterns, these activities are insufficient to guarantee equal services to poor persons in the poorest areas compared with those in wealthier cities. Regression analyses indicate that higher levels of nonprofit antipoverty activity are likely to be found in older and centrally located cities with higher socioeconomic status and significant government contribution to the provision of social services. These findings suggest that nonprofits and governments ought to be seen as complements rather than substitutes in efforts to alleviate intrametropolitan poverty disparities."
323	2003	NVSQ	32:01:00	The Changing Relationship Between Nonprofit Organizations and Public Social Service Agencies in the Era of Welfare Reform	"The implementation of welfare reform in the United States provides another opportunity to assess the relationship between nonprofits and public social service agencies. The primary goal of this analysis is to identify the major forces affecting the county social services agencies as they sought to implement welfare reform and how these forces can affect the agency's relationship with community-based nonprofit service providers. The internal and external dimensions of the organizational change process are assessed in terms of the central concepts of devolution, privatization, and community building."

Evidence from this study of two U.K. voluntary organizations demonstrates that they are using ICTs to reconfigure key information flows in support of enhanced campaigning and more effective user services. The study also reveals that adherence to embedded values and relationships tempers the extent to which the organizations are able to exploit opportunities for radical shifts in organizational arrangements that the transformational potential of the technologies makes possible. This article describes the way in which emergent tensions have been reconciled as both organizations seek to exploit the transformational capability of ICTs in ways that accommodate, and largely sustain, their organizational values."
325	2003	NVSQ	32:01:00	Fund-Raising and the Articulation of Common Goods	"Nonprofit organizations enable citizens to engage in diverse sorts of public action for the sake of common goods. Nonprofits' importance is recognized in political theory but less so in applied ethics. This article examines fund-raising from the perspective of applied ethics through examining Albert Anderson's Ethics for Fundraisers. The article's concern is not fund-raisers' day-to-day routine but the relationships they establish. Fund-raisers, it is proposed, emphasize developing relations with donors but not between donors and recipients, thereby creating the danger of donor dominance. Fund-raising, moreover, falls victim to business imagery likening donors with customers or stockholders and uncritically comparing fund-raising with marketing. Through analyzing these analogies, the article concludes that fund-raisers should seek to engage donors with the work, needs, and beneficiaries of their organization and articulate how nonprofits enable donors and beneficiaries to participate together in articulating and implementing public action for the common good."
326	2003	NVSQ	32:02:00	Fostering Neighborhood Democracy: Legitimacy and Accountability within Loosely Coupled Systems	"This article explores the range of organizations and participatory mechanisms that take on some aspect of the role of neighborhood-based governance (in some way speaking for or acting on behalf of their neighborhoods) in three cities. It describes the extent to which they perform similar or different functions and discusses the strengths and weaknesses presented by the system of relationships as they are currently structured. It also explores two key issues legitimacy and accountability in an attempt to distill lessons about the relative roles and effectiveness of these different participatory mechanisms and community organizations and the relationships among them. The article suggests ways that sponsors (including foundations and government) can more effectively engage with neighborhoods and promote neighborhood-based decision making and action and highlights some unanswered questions that might be pursued as part of a larger research agenda to inform the practical pursuit of participatory, community-building strategies."

Drawing on both approaches, this article seeks an understanding of the changing configuration of the sector by investigating the dimension of flexibility in the relation between nonprofits and their various dynamic environments. The approach is developed for the German case. The analysis not only permits identification of the underpinnings of the old corporatist model, shaping the German third sector as a social sphere between the state and the market economy, but also points at the factors leading to a gradual erosion of that model. Moreover, it allows a brief exploration of the evolutionary dynamics of the German nonprofit fields in comparison to major international trends."
328	2003	NVSQ	32:02:00	What Factors Affect the Entry and Exit of Nonprofit Human Service Organizations in Metropolitan Areas?	"The goal of this article is to advance the literature on nonprofit organizational adaptation by assessing the factors that significantly contribute to the entry and exit of human service organizations in metropolitan areas. More specifically, this study uses nonprofit, economic and demographic data and information on welfare reform implementation patterns to examine the causes of the formation and deaths of groups in the nonprofit human service sector from 1992 to 1996. This time frame marked the widespread implementation of welfare reform under the federal Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) waiver program. This study found that organizational size, age, and service activities are the key determinants in the failure of human service nonprofits, whereas environmental factors such as AFDC waiver implementation relate to the widespread formation of nonprofit providers."
329	2003	NVSQ	32:02:00	Grassroots Associations Versus Larger Nonprofits: New Evidence from a Community Case Study in Arts and Culture	"Very small nonprofit organizations are typically omitted from sector accounts, because neither the IRS nor the Bureau of Census collect data on these groups. Arguably, this may not pose a major problem. Prevailing economic theories in the nonprofit field direct attention to larger and more formal service-providing organizations. From an economic point of view, very small and informal organizations are of lesser importance. However, social capital and civil society arguments have focused renewed attention on informal, voluntaristic groups, many of which are likely small in scale and thus being missed in existing data sources. This article presents data from a community study of cultural organizations, comparing small-scale groups to larger organizations to contribute to our understanding of the economic dimensions of the nonprofit sector's grassroots base."
330	2003	NVSQ	32:02:00	Response Rates for Mail Surveys of Nonprofit Organizations: A Review and Empirical Test	"The failure of a substantial portion of mail survey recipients to respond to invitations to participate in research projects raises issues of nonresponse error. Because this error is difficult to quantify, survey researchers seek high rates of return to signal legitimacy and reduce questions regarding nonresponse bias. Research on survey method indicates that the design of the survey research process has a measurable influence on the rate of survey returns. This article focuses on three aspects of research design that are expected to influence mail survey returns in surveys of nonprofit organizations: questionnaire complexity, use of Federal Express versus standard mail, and the use of monetary incentives. Using an experimental design, the research concludes that questionnaire complexity and the use of monetary incentives generate no difference in returns, whereas the use of Federal Express to deliver the survey to nonprofit executives has a measurable positive effect."
331	2003	NVSQ	32:02:00	Challenges and Opportunities in Implementing a Rights-Based Approach to Development: An Oxfam America Perspective	"Two practitioners/thinkers take old ideas about human rights and make a new case for an economic and social rights-based approach to development. Our mid-20th century predecessors recognized in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Four Freedoms and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that a secure world requires a social contract that assures everyone access to basic economic and social rights. In today's globalized world, the private sector and civil society join the state in influencing the ability of the marginalized to enjoy basic rights. Pursuing a rights-based approach is an end to business as usual for international development nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). NGOs will need to move beyond supporting delivery of services to building the capacity of civil society to be an organized and effective balance to the power of governments and of the private sector. This transformation will have profound effects on the basic business plans, evaluation systems, and staff competencies of international development NGOs."
332	2003	NVSQ	32:03:00	Democracy and Associations in Denmark: Changing Relationships between Individuals and Associations?	"In recent years, many have voiced doubts about whether participation in associations still has the same meaning for democracy. These doubts are related to new observations of changes in the relations between individuals and associations. The author confronts these observations with new empirical findings on the relation between members and organizations, including data on the development of membership and activity in Denmark, on the relationship between associational involvement and civic engagement, and on the members assessment of their influence in organizations. The empirical findings both support and modify the rather pessimistic views on the democratic role of associations. In the final section, the findings are related to consideration of changes in the membership role, particularly among youth, which may signal a looser and more flexible relationship between individuals and associations in the future."
333	2003	NVSQ	32:03:00	"Politics and the Origins of the Nonprofit Corporation in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, 1780-1820"	"This article explores the origins of the nonprofit corporation following American independence. Corporations had long been considered state agencies responsible to and under the control of state leaders. Both Federalists and Republicans believed that corporate trustees were political officeholders. Only in the face of intense partisan and religious conflict did they change their minds. By examining debates over the legal status of colleges and churches, this article explains how party politics and religious pluralism convinced leaders in Massachusetts and New Hampshire to distinguish between nonprofit corporations and the state. These debates culminated in the United States Supreme Court case of Dartmouth College v. Woodward. The court ruled that private corporations were protected from state control. The decision provided the legal foundation for the subsequent development of the nonprofit corporation and civil society in the United States."
334	2003	NVSQ	32:03:00	Differences in the Response of Women's Voluntary Organizations to Shifts in Canadian Public Policy	"Executive directors of 351 women's voluntary organizations and 294 `other' (gender neutral) organizations were surveyed to gauge their responses to changing public policy in Canada. Findings indicate that although all organizations are unhappy with the current environmental shifts and pessimistic about the future, women's organizations are more critical of policy changes and their implementation. They also feel more vulnerable and pessimistic about the future. Strategically, they are less likely to adopt a business-like competitive orientation, focusing more on fostering cooperation and collaboration. These findings support evidence in the literature that suggests that women's organizations seek solutions that are more consistent with a collaborative model than a competitive one. They also underline that women's organizations, often serving more marginal niches, have unique concerns and thus respond differently to environmental changes. Furthermore, the data suggest that both ideological orientation and organizational composition may play a role in differentiating between women's and other organizations."
335	2003	NVSQ	32:03:00	The Changing Role of Nonprofits in the Network Economy	"The new network economy presents fresh challenges to nonprofit organizations. Some of the relative advantages nonprofits now enjoy, compared to business and government, in providing services characterized by information asymmetry and public goods characteristics are likely to be eroded by changes in information technology. At the same time, the network economy also offers nonprofits special opportunities, including a role as trusted intermediaries to help people cope with a deluge of complex information. This article applies economic theory to derive expectations of the changing role of nonprofits in the information age and considers how nonprofits can respond effectively to the new circumstances."
336	2003	NVSQ	32:03:00	The Compact: Attempts to Regulate Relationships between Government and the Voluntary Sector in England	"In 1996, an independent inquiry into the voluntary sector in England recommended that there should be a `concordat' or `compact' embodying agreed guidelines for relationships between government and the voluntary sector. Since then, work has been continuous on drafting both a basic Compact and more detailed codes to regulate the behavior of both parties in areas such as funding, consultation, the use of volunteers, contacts with Black and ethnic minority organizations, etc. The Compact and several codes are now in force. Current questions include whether their existence can be made known to the thousands of individuals and organizations involved and whether, having no legal force, they can become effective constraints on inappropriate actions."
337	2003	NVSQ	32:04:00	"Board Composition, Committees, and Organizational Efficiency: The Case of Nonprofits"	"This article investigates the relationship between nonprofit board composition and organizational efficiency. Overall, we find a significant statistical association between the presence of major donors on the board and indicators of organizational efficiency. Although causality cannot be demonstrated, our findings are consistent with the Fama and Jensen (1983) conjecture that major donors monitor nonprofit organizations at least in part through their board membership. The multivariate analysis shows that the ratio of total expenses to program expenses is significantly and negatively associated with higher donor representation. Decomposing the total expense ratio into its two components, we find that different factors affect the administrative and fundraising expense ratios. The percentage of major donors on the finance committee, a key committee overseeing budgets and administrative expenses, is negatively related to the organization's administrative expenses ratio. The presence of major donors on other board committees is not significantly statistically associated with nonprofit efficiency."
338	2003	NVSQ	32:04:00	Understanding the Behavior of Nonprofit Boards of Directors: A Theory-Based Approach	"The literature on nonprofit boards of directors is rich with prescriptive advice about the kinds of activities that should occupy the board's time and attention. Using organizational theory that has dominated the empirical investigation of private sector board behavior (agency, resource dependence, and institutional), this article contributes to the literature on nonprofit board governance in three important ways. First, it provides a link between theory and practice by identifying the theoretical assumptions that have served as the foundation for the best practice literature. Second, the article presents a theory-based framework of board behavior that identifies the environmental conditions and board/organizational considerations that are likely to affect board behavior. And finally, it offers a set of hypotheses that can be used in future empirical investigations that seeks to understand the conditions under which a nonprofit board might assume certain roles and responsibilities over others."

The article also presents a systematic comparison of this model to others previously used in Giving USA. During the 1990s, the most recent period for which an evaluation of the models is possible, the three most recent Giving USA models would have performed well. However, of these, the model presented herein would have provided somewhat more accurate estimates"

An implementation measure of the policy governance model was created to investigate these relationships. Data were gathered from three samples: organizations that have implemented policy governance, a matched sample of randomly selected nonprofit organizations, and nonprofit organizations that had received board development from the National Center for Nonprofit Boards. Analysis yielded several positive, significant relationships between the extent of implementation of policy governance board behaviors, perceptions of improvement in board performance following implementation of policy governance, and some aspects of organizational effectiveness."
341	2003	NVSQ	32:04:00	"Trust, Accreditation, and Philanthropy in the Netherlands"	"Given the increasing numbers of scandals, the awareness among fund-raisers that the public's trust is crucial for the nonprofit sector is growing. This study investigates the relationship between trust and charitable giving. Charitable organizations can increase the public's trust by signaling their trustworthiness. The example of the Netherlands shows how a system of accreditation can be an instrument for signaling trustworthiness to the public. Donors aware of the accreditation system have more trust in charities than those who are not aware, and they give more money to charitable causes. Charitable organizations have only limited control over the public's trust because it is also rooted in a general social trust in institutions and fellow citizens. It was shown that general social trust increases the amount people give to charitable causes, even more so when people know about the accreditation system. Finally, the conditions for introducing an accreditation system are discussed."
342	2003	NVSQ	32:04:00	Assessing Potential Accounting Manipulation: the Financial Characteristics of Charitable Organizations with Higher than Expected Program-Spending Ratios	"Accounting manipulation is defined as when the managers of an organization intentionally misstate their financial information to favorably represent the entity's financial performance. Managers of nonprofit organizations may have incentives to manipulate their reported program-spending ratios because donors use them in determining contribution decisions. The program-spending ratio is the percentage of expenses that is allocated to programs rather than to administrative or fundraising functions. In this study, I analyze the financial characteristics of potential accounting manipulators: those organizations that have program-spending ratios significantly higher than expected. I limit the study to relatively large nonprofit charitable organizations (charities) and use six financial indicators of accounting manipulation to develop a predictive model. The model is significant, with most of the financial indicators significantly contributing to the overall model. Also, within certain parameters, the model can predict with reasonable accuracy whether or not a charity is a potential accounting manipulator."
343	2004	NVSQ	33:01:00	Funding Relations between Nonprofits and Government: A Positive Example	"This article examines the attributes of a successful contracting model for the financing and support of nonprofit organizations. It describes how, through government initiative, a program can be built in which transaction costs are minimized through a cooperative approach to contracting based on mutual trust. It shows how investment in a long-term, trust-based, cooperative relationship underlined by professional standards and a continuous focus on a common mission by all levels of actors within and without government can provide the impetus for a system in which high standards of service are maintained, accountability is organic, and organizations feel supported in their mission but not controlled. The example presented is a provincial government program for the prevention of family violence in Manitoba, Canada, but the features that make it successful can be applied widely."
344	2004	NVSQ	33:01:00	Valuing Volunteers: An Economic Evaluation of the Net Benefits of Hospital Volunteers	"The use of volunteers in hospitals has been an age-old practice. This nonmarket community involvement is a distinctive aspect of North American life. Hospitals may be attracted to increase the use of volunteers, both to provide increased quality of care and to contain costs. Hospitals rely on the use of professional administrators to use the donated time of volunteers efficiently. This study examines the benefits and costs of volunteer programs and derives an estimate of the net value of volunteer programs that accrue to the hospitals and volunteers. In particular, the costs and benefits to hospitals are detailed. Using 31 hospitals in and around Toronto and surveying hospital volunteer administrators, hospital clinical staff members, and volunteers themselves, a striking pay-off for hospitals was found: an average of $6.84 in value from volunteers for every dollar spent a return on investment of 684%. Civic and community participation is indeed valuable."

The Study of Midlife gathered data from 258 working respondents ages 50 to 64 on demographic information, retirement plans, and voluntarism. The data are consistent with continuity and role theories. Those who consider the volunteer role highly salient are much more likely to see volunteering as part of an ideal retirement lifestyle as are those who frequently attend religious services. Workers less than 5 years away from planned retirement are less likely to see voluntarism as part of an ideal retirement lifestyle, regardless of age, indicating that location in one's own life course influences perceptions of volunteering in retirement. Implications for volunteer recruitment strategies for nonprofit organizations are discussed."

Based on site visits, interviews on campuses and in host communities, document analysis, and literature reviews, four key findings emerged: (a) shifting and varying emphases in main components of engagement, (b) local factors that facilitate and present barriers to engagement, (c) intellectual rationales and projects to drive new knowledge, involve faculty, and institutionalize and sustain engagement, and (d) new organizational structures to link the campus and community and share power and resources. The argument is made for a dynamic and developmental framework that acknowledges multiplicity and flow. The article concludes with an initial mapping of changing relationships between local factors and civic-engagement program emphases and an articulation of three main current theories of engagement that a developmental framework would take into account."

Less well known are the voluntary alternatives to serving in the IDF through National Service. This study deals with the characteristics of National Service volunteers, their views and motives for service, their levels of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with their work, and proposals for changes in the National Service. The random sample included 40 volunteers. The instruments were developed specifically for this study. The findings suggest that parents and friends have the greatest influence on the decision to serve in the National Service. Altruistic motives are the main category of motivation for serving, followed by environmental pressure, and idealism. Overall, respondents were satisfied with their experiences, especially in regard to their coworkers' attitudes. Although some dissatisfaction was expressed, it was not with the work itself but rather with the lack of public appreciation."
348	2004	NVSQ	33:01:00	Typology of Religious Characteristics of Social Service and Educational Organizations and Programs	"The general term faith-based organizations is inadequate because no clear definition exists of what it means to be faith-based. This article proposes an inductively derived sixfold typology of social service and educational organizations and programs based on their religious characteristics: faith-permeated, faith-centered, faith-affiliated, faith background, faith-secular partnership, and secular. The typology is divided into two sections, organizations and programs, recognizing that the religious characteristics of an organization may differ from the programs it operates. The analysis of religious characteristics focuses on the tangibly expressive ways that religion may be manifest in a nonprofit entity. The article provides examples of each type based on case studies of 15 congregations with active community-serving programs. This framework, once empirically tested, can add clarity and precision to research, public discourse, and funding decisions concerning community-serving organizations."

It operationalizes trust and commitment by developing measurement scales for each construct. The technique of structural equation modeling is used to determine whether trust directly affects giving behavior or whether its effects are mediated by commitment. It is concluded that commitment plays a mediating role, and implications for professional fundraising practice are discussed."
350	2004	NVSQ	33:02:00	Nonprofit Arts Organizations: Do Funding Sources Influence Spending Patterns?	"Concern over the funding of nonprofit organizations has raised issues concerning the amount of money available for the provision of services and the potential that changes in the nature of funding will compromise organizational goals. Because of increased competition and government cutbacks, nonprofits will be forced to place more reliance on commercial ventures. This has the potential to negatively affect the behavior of recipient organizations. The question addressed in this article is whether greater reliance on private funding and commercial ventures will ultimately cause nonprofit arts organizations to place less emphasis on program services and more emphasis on fundraising and management expenses. The analysis is focused on three categories of nonprofit arts organizations: museums, performing arts, and media and communications. Overall, the provision of program services appears to be the primary goal of organizations in these three sectors, and greater reliance on private funding does not divert funding from program service delivery."

Information was obtained on nonprofit and for-profit education and human service providers in six metropolitan areas. Methods of spatial econometrics were used to examine the determinants of nonprofit locational patterns and the degree to which the locations of nonprofits were influenced by the locations of comparable nonprofits and for-profits. Similar nonprofits were found to be clustered, although the pattern differed across metropolitan areas. For the most part, a model of needs and resources explained the clustering. Exceptions were found, however, indicating clustering based on other factors over and above needs and resources. For educational support services, nonprofits were affected by comparable nonprofits in two sites. In youth services, nonprofits tend to locate near comparable for-profits. In Boston, nonprofits clustered with for-profits in a number of service categories."

This research fills a gap in the literature regarding the relationship between volunteering and confidence in charitable institutions. It models volunteering as impure altruism joint consumption of a public good (charity) and a private good (clubbiness). Confidence affects the consumption of the public good but not the private good. The feedback effect of volunteering on confidence is also considered. Low-confidence people may volunteer because they are asked and then gain confidence in charitable institutions by working with them. A two-equation bivariate probit model separately identifies the effect of confidence in charitable institutions on volunteering and the opposite effect of volunteering on confidence. Empirical results support hypotheses that recruiting a person to volunteer overrides a lack of confidence in charitable institutions and volunteering fosters confidence in charitable institutions. The latter effect is stronger thereby suggesting that declining confidence is self-correcting.

Limited research addresses if, or how, religious and nonreligious givers respond to subsidies. This article uses experimental data to examine differences in the amount and pattern of giving to secular charities in response to subsidies by self-identified religious and nonreligious participants. The results indicate no significant difference in either the amount or pattern of giving or in the response to subsidies by religious and nonreligious participants, however, giving by religious participants is significantly more responsive to income changes than giving by nonreligious participants."

Based on an in-depth qualitative case study of a single, Canadian, nonprofit human services organization, this article proposes that being business-like in a nonprofit setting can be understood in at least four distinct categories: as goals of programs, as organization of either program service delivery or organizational management, and as organizational rhetoric."

Nonprofit and Resident Perceptions of Urban Neighborhood Problems	"Using 85 qualitative interviews collected in three low-income Philadelphia neighborhoods as part of the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation's (MDRC) Project on Devolution and Urban Change, nonprofit directors and poor residents' views of neighborhood problems, other residents, and services needed were examined. In doing so, the assumption that local nonprofit leadership is in touch with the resident population that they serve was questioned. Nonprofit directors described neighborhood problems related to unemployment and education, whereas residents focused on crime and safety issues. Both groups agreed that drugs were a major problem in the community. Additionally, the resident group conveyed a more negative view of other neighborhood residents than the nonprofit directors did. Lastly, nonprofit directors wanted to add job placement and training services, whereas residents wanted to add youth programs. Overall, nonprofit directors across neighborhoods held more similar views with each other than they did with residents within their own communities."
356	2004	NVSQ	33:02:00	Professional Corporate Donation Programs in Canada: An Exploratory Study	"This article reports the results of an exploratory study on corporate philanthropy using a sample of 206 Canadian companies. The results show that a corporation is more likely to have a professional donation program if it is large, privately owned, and the manager of the corporation acts as a volunteer fundraiser for a charitable organization. The second part of the study finds that the level of contributions made is positively related to the size of the organization and whether it has a professional donation program. However, economic constraints, imposed by debt covenant restrictions, reduce the amount donated. Finally, the results indicate a reciprocal relationship between the existence of a professional donation program and the level of philanthropic contributions."
357	2004	NVSQ	33:02:00	Underestimating the Power of Nonprofit Governance	"Much of the dialogue around nonprofit boards has focused on secondary or transactional issues rather than on the question of what good governance must include in a nonprofit setting. This serves to rob the nonprofits of creativity, rigor, power, and the kind of finely tuned understanding of accountability the public should expect. By focusing on the central questions and principles of nonprofit governance rather than on structural concerns, the possibilities for a wider variation in governance models open up. All organizations are set in a larger social context, so we cannot end our reflection at the individual nonprofit level. These questions are particularly pertinent during a period when our attention is focused on governance from Wall Street to Baghdad. Some believe that public governance is overly affected by corporate interests, and we are now seeing case after case of scandals exposing ethical problems in the governance of corporations that only recently were seen as exemplary. This puts the interests of ordinary and particularly marginalized people at risk. In a democracy, the nonprofit sector is there to ensure that people have a voice in our future at the community, national, and global levels. If we accept this as our primary role, it has implications for what should be present as constants in our governance structures."
358	2004	NVSQ	33:03:00	Exploring Strategy and Board Structure in Nonprofit Organizations	"This research explores how nonprofit managers conceptualize their organization's strategic orientation toward products and services and in what way the governing board is structured to match that orientation. Using the Miles and Snow typology of strategy and a survey of 132 nonprofit organizations, organizations were categorized into four strategic types (e.g., defenders, prospectors, analyzers, or reactors), and distinctive structural patterns in board committees and composition were found. Prospectors had broader, more inclusive structures, whereas defenders tended to have tighter, more focused structures. Although some patterns appeared muted, through in-depth interviews with selected exemplars, several characteristics were found that helped define and clarify nonprofit strategy. This included the use of mission statements to help communicate the organization's strategic orientation."

This research aims to add to the literature by including various forms of religiosity and social capital. Using survey data (N = 1,038), this article investigates four volunteer groups (church volunteers, volunteers in both church and other contexts, non-church volunteers, nonvolunteers) and answers three questions: How do their sociodemographic and religious backgrounds differ, how does religiosity affect the probability of belonging to these groups, and how do these groups differ in regard to their social capital? The article indicates that religiosity affects choosing between the four volunteer groups and that these groups maintain different kinds of social capital."

"Surveys of charitable giving typically find that a substantial proportion of respondents say they do not know how much they gave in the past year. In this article, it is argued that these responses tend to distort giving levels among certain demographic groups, thus compromising the accuracy of charity measures. This problem is illustrated using data from the 2000 Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey, and the groups that are the primary source of this distortion are identified"
361	2004	NVSQ	33:03:00	Toward Nonprofit Organization Reform in the Voluntary Spirit: Lessons from the Internet	"This article identifies two models of nonprofit organization roles: the economic model, which emphasizes business-like methods, and the voluntary spirit model, which emphasizes participation and membership. Highly visible, professional nonprofit organizations must constantly struggle with the extent to which they are to emphasize their role as efficient and competitive economic actors or their role as institutions important to our democracy. After years of shifting toward the economic model, professional nonprofits may be ripe for reform. Simultaneously, they are confronting and engaging with the Internet. This article draws on examples of health-based citizen cyber-organizations to derive lessons for how professional nonprofit organizations can recapture their voluntary spirit generally and places an emphasis on participation and membership. Also derived are specific lessons on how professional nonprofits can use cyber-strategies to do so."
362	2004	NVSQ	33:03:00	Interface Dynamics in Cause-Based Partnerships: An Exploration of Emergent Culture	"This article examines the behavioral dynamics at the interface between organizations in strategic partnerships called cause-based partnerships (CBPs). These are partnerships between a corporation and one or more nonprofit organizations that address social meta problems such as environmental sustainability or social-justice challenges. Various a priori differences such as tasks, processes, and organizational cultures are expected to affect outcomes, but this article argues that a key determinant of successful CBP performance is behavioral dynamics at the interface between the partners. This article builds a framework for understanding these behavioral dynamics in terms of an emergent culture. Three scenarios integration, reculturation, and separation are described for how participants in CBPs continually negotiate a workable set of cultural practices among them-selves. Examples are based on interviews with CBP managers. These explorations expand the basis for understanding CBP dynamics beyond those provided by static task, process, or common-culture explanations."

The network was formed in response to a major shift in the state's funding mechanism from fee-for-service to managed care. When confronted with conflicting institutional pressures from the state and the profession, the response was one of strategic balancing and compromise through development of an interorganizational network rather than by the passive conformity of individual agencies. How this network evolved and how compromise was achieved was examined. Data were collected shortly after the new system was first introduced and then 4 years later to allow longitudinal analysis of network evolution."

Why do some communities provide services with volunteer labor whereas others rely primarily on government provision? When communities provide both volunteer and paid labor for the same service, how do they motivate and organize those volunteers? This article addresses these questions through quantitative tests of prevailing explanations for levels of civic engagement (e.g., education, TV viewing, urbanization) and qualitative analyses of case studies of three medium-sized cities in Japan, focusing particularly on the service areas of firefighting and elder care. The statistical analyses demonstrate that current explanations that rely on individual characteristics cannot predict or explain volunteer participation at the community level of analysis. Using the case study data, a model is developed to predict the rate of volunteer participation in a community. It is concluded that the practices of governmental and social institutions how well they legitimize, fund, and organize volunteers determine the rate of volunteer participation in a community."

Specifically, the authors examine the emergence of grassroots organizations in cyberspace. An analysis of two cyber-grassroots organizations (CGOs), Afghanistan Online and Rebuild-Afghanistan, highlights CGOs' similarities, differences, and relative strengths and weaknesses compared to their traditional physical-space counterparts. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications for our understanding of grassroots organizations generally. Traditional characteristics such as size, scope, and the nature of communication need to be refined to better account for new forms of grassroots organizations."

The authors identify eight distinct areas in which community organizing groups are connecting community capacity to school improvement. Leadership development and the production of social capital build community power to address issues of failing schools. The broadening of public accountability for school improvement creates the political will to improve schools in low-income neighborhoods. The resulting school improvement strategies enable stronger school/community connections, improved curriculum and instruction, and a positive school climate with the ultimate goal of achieving equity between schools in low-income and higher-income neighborhoods. Using data from case studies of five community organizing groups nationwide and focusing on the story of the Oakland Community Organizations' small-schools campaign, the authors illustrate how members of low-and moderate-income communities are both demanding change and building the support and capacity for public school improvement."

Insular Neighborhood Associations, Nonreciprocal Civility, and the Promotion of Civic Health"	"This article examines whether a high number of neighborhood associations within a community promotes or hinders civic health and offers two concepts for civil society scholarship: the insular civil society organization (CSO), which is primarily or solely committed to internal development and membership cultivation, and nonreciprocal civility, which captures the absence of relational ties between such CSOs. Based on the analysis of two urban neighborhoods in Baltimore, Maryland, the authors found that a high number of neighborhood associations reflect community-level factionalism, primarily manifested through resource competition and turf conflict. This was apparent despite strong consensus among community residents on key community issues and concerns. Possible reasons for this factionalism are identified, the consequences of such divisiveness for civic health are examined, and suggestions for addressing the limitations posed by insular associations are offered."

Organizational records of 86 CBOs and 125 IMOs are evaluated. It was found that CBOs mobilize substantially more community members and are more likely to devote their efforts toward leadership development and organization building. On the other hand, IMOs are far more likely to employ aggressive social change tactics, whereas CBOs focus more on consensus issues. Finally, IMOs employ a far more diverse array of grassroots funding strategies. The generalizability of these findings is discussed."

To what extent are these pervasive changes reflected in changing female participation patterns and, subsequently, organizational change? Using unique, quantitative, historical data, we conclude that female representation in voluntary associations has increased substantially within growing segments of the sector. However, women are still underrepresented in leading positions, and new associations are most frequently founded by men. Furthermore, all-female organizations, historically sources of extensive political and ideological influence, are rapidly disappearing."

The growth of service may warrant a distinct field of study in which a comparative knowledge base could inform development and implementation of policies and programs. In this article, the authors summarize results of a global assessment of civic service. Searching by country and using information from organizational memberships, publications, and the Internet, 210 civic service programs were identified in 57 countries. This study has many limitations, raising more questions than it answers. Nonetheless, it is the first worldwide empirical glimpse of service, shedding light on several key questions: What are the current status and forms of civic service? What are its structures, goals, and effects? This introductory article of the special issue frames these questions for consideration by the authors, who identify historical and cultural determinants, forms, and mediators of civic service in different regions of the world."

National and international service including local, informal, and community-based service continues to remain prominent and is an appropriate response to the intractable development issues facing these societies. New initiatives to address the marginalization of Africa from the new information economy and society will need to keep human development on the agenda. Civic service can make a significant contribution to mobilizing local and international efforts in partnership with governments and civil society. Future research and policy should address the institutional impediments to service, develop research capacity to strengthen a scholarship of civic engagement, and conceive of service as part of a broader social development strategy."

The role of religion is highlighted. Also discussed are demo-graphic, economic, and political factors that have influenced the development of volunteer and civic service programs in the region. Although systematic information and research are limited, civic service program examples are detailed. These examples include religiously based service programs, service-learning programs at the university level, and local programs. Official civic service initiatives and national policies are not specified or widespread, but program developments may have the potential to develop into such policies. More research is recommended regarding the role of the state and civil society in the development of civic service programs and the role of civic service in social and economic development."

This article presents an overview of the different forms that civic service has taken in Israel, with the predominant form being the national youth service (NYS, Sherut Leumi in Hebrew). The article describes the controversies around the participation of Palestinian citizens of Israel in the NYS. Finally, the main conceptual issues to be addressed when devising prospects and policy directions are highlighted. The concern is raised whether the NYS in Israel is a segregating experience or rather an experience that provides a common civic denominator to all parts of society. In view of the complex reality of the Middle East in general and Israel in particular, prospects and policy directions concerning civic service are discussed."

Drawing a distinction between civic service and traditional volunteering, it traces the history of the concept in the region and the resurgence of government interest in it over the past decade, fueled in particular by the decline in military service brought about by the end of the Cold War. The article explores both the strengths and weaknesses of government action in this field and looks at the challenges facing the voluntary sector in managing its development. It concludes with a review of the evidence of the effect of civic service on the key stakeholder groups and makes recommendations for policy makers, for practitioners, and for further research."

It seeks to identify those elements of the cultural and historical background and the present social, political, and economic challenges that have a significant effect on the development of service programs. Based on the available anecdotal and research information, the article gives an overview of civic services, their goals, actual forms, predominant types, and institutional background. Motivations, sociodemographic characteristics, and social embeddedness of the participants of service programs are also discussed. The final part of the article offers a list of possible research approaches and projects that would be necessary to understand all aspects of this complex and heterogeneous set of interactions."

In particular, the authors examine the rise and fall of the government-sponsored National Development Service and its relationship to democratic culture. The case of national service in Nepal underscores the importance of examining the social and political context of national service. Service programs can be a source of widespread societal change and a vehicle for expressing discontent with the status quo. If a significant consequence of civic service is to foster democratic citizenship, then as the authors' case suggests, it is necessary to examine the nature and life course of service programs."
377	2004	NVSQ	33:4 (supp)	Civic Service in East Asia and the Pacific	"Civic service in the East Asia and Pacific region is historically complex and is currently not equivalent to the Western concept of civic service. Civic service in the region began as a concept and practice of moral suasion and responsibility to nation, obeisance to authority, and traditional belief of co-responsibility to serve and help others. In the beginning, acts of civic service were led and managed by the state. As colonialism waned and independence ensued, civic service assumed democratic features characterized by the emergence of voluntary groups that rendered service and less state centeredness, and the forms significantly changed from patriotic acts of national defense to localized community development. Several developments became obvious: international service rather than just locally based service, leadership by voluntary organizations, and expressions of service across age groups and service providers. Implications for research on the nature, forms, and effects of service are noted."
378	2004	NVSQ	33:4 (supp)	Civic Service in South America	"This article explores the history and current forms of civic service in South America. The term is fraught with translation difficulty, but the operational forms are consistent. Service learning is by far the most prevalent form of service in South America and is discussed in detail. Other forms of service are briefly discussed, including national and international service. All forms of service are placed in historical context and viewed through an institutional lens. It is suggested that service learning is the most prevalent form of service because educational institutions are trusted. Implications for research are discussed, such as how to associate civic service with common concepts, and next steps regarding descriptive research."
379	2004	NVSQ	33:4 (supp)	Civic Service in North America	"Civic service is well established in North America, where the United States and Canada are among the world leaders. The evolution of civic service has not been a story of continuous growth but rather one of episodic and cyclical development. The past decade's events indicate that civic service is in a new cycle of growth and innovation. Among the reasons for the health of civic service in North America are the institutional structures there that define it. Civic service institutions in Mexico, largely because of its status as a developing country, are less accessible and less supportive of the service role than institutions in the rest of North America, where civic service is widely accessible to all types of servers and all social sectors are legitimately perceived as civic service providers. Open access is complemented by incentives and support for servers and organizations providing service opportunities. Several priorities are identified for further research."

Focusing on the cultural bases of volunteerism, a representative sample of 652 Flemish Red Cross volunteers is grouped according to a multidimensional set of attitudinal measures. The Unconditional, Critical, Reliable, and Distant dispositional clusters that emerge from the analysis cohere with distinct patterns of volunteering, ranging from core to peripheral volunteer positions. Furthermore, both cultural modernization indicators and organizational features account for the dispositional variations observed. Although the analysis conducted clearly reveals the surplus value of a multidimensional sight on volunteering, the research outcomes warn against a too-strong focus on grand modernization narratives. The cultural bases of Flemish Red Cross volunteering may best be understood in terms of a threefold dynamic: Differences in cultural frames of reference intervene with life cycle effects and processes of organizational socialization."

It is based on interviews with the pastors of 15 congregations actively engaged in faith-based community organizing in three cities. The results suggest that community organizing fits into congregations' localized priorities, with the majority of the pastors expressing primarily local concerns. Organizing has led to tangible community improvements, especially within poorer communities that are often excluded from professionalized forms of civic engagement. It has strengthened congregations' social service efforts, which appear to be more extensive than is the norm. However, the most frequently cited benefit was the creation of relational bonds among diverse congregations."

The study reveals that as foundations exhibited preferences for supporting antipoverty work that they saw as politically safe and uncontroversial, community organizations enticed foundations to expand the range of funding agendas that suited these preferences. This finding is of timely significance given that during the past 2 decades, policy-making responsibility has shifted from the public to the philanthropic sectors"

The authors find that the results are consistent with those found in the earlier analyses, namely, that longer, more detailed prompts led respondents to recall giving and volunteering at higher incidence rates (proportion donating at all or volunteering at all) and at higher levels (dollars given or hours volunteered) than when compared to survey methodologies with fewer prompts."

That trend has recently reversed itself. Over the same time, food bank output has consistently increased. Research has not shown whether hunger is decreasing or whether there is a change in how food security is provided. To address this question, this study examined the combined monthly food outflow patterns of 193 emergency food providers (EFPs) in central North Carolina from 1995 to 2000. Through surveys and regression analysis, the authors find that although administrators felt that increased EFP usage was due to economic stress and population growth, the data instead show an inverse relationship with the number of public assistance recipients and a positive relationship with food stamp recipients. Although these results cannot explain individual behavior, they raise continued concerns over the growing role of nonprofits in providing food security."

In this article, they explore the nature and correlates of ownership-related expectations in medical care. Data from a new national survey document that most Americans believe that ownership affects medical care. However, about a third of the public does not understand ownership, those who do not have decidedly less favorable attitudes toward nonprofits. Expectations for nonprofits are more positive among those who feel vulnerable to bad outcomes in medical care, but are substantially more negative among minority groups. Using an experimental design incorporated into the survey, the authors demonstrate that having additional information about ownership improves expectations about nonprofit performance but to varying degrees, depending on the content of the explanation, the particular dimension of performance, and the level of prior understanding."

A Multidimensional Integrated Model of Nonprofit Organizational Effectiveness	"Few topics in nonprofit research and practice have received greater attention in recent years than organizational effectiveness. In spite of this intellectual interest, little consensus has emerged, either theoretically or empirically, as to what constitutes organizational effectiveness and how best to measure it. In this article, we introduce a multidimensional and integrated model of nonprofit organizational effectiveness (MIMNOE). The model captures two prominent dimensions of organizational effectiveness, management effectiveness and program effectiveness. In addition, to illustrate how this framework can be used empirically, the article proposes a method of analysis that exploits the interrelationships between the multiple dimensions in the model. MIMNOE is useful for both scholars and practitioners because it requires attention not only to program outcomes, but also equally to the factors that influence those outcomes."

Hypothetically applying corresponding German rules to Ford Foundation data, this article suggests that U.S. regulation of foundation spending policies is already stricter than elsewhere and that much of the current policy debate has little to do with the original intentions of the requirement. Reevaluating the underlying rationale of the policy, the article concludes with a proposal to introduce time limits to the payout requirement"

This article seeks to understand the dynamics between nonprofit and for-profit organizations operating within the same market. The authors propose a five-step theoretical framework that includes both nonprofit and for-profit actors to capture what is fundamentally a temporal process: market identification, market growth, increasing cost for goods/services, increasing price for goods/services, and cross-sector competition. The authors use data from extended qualitative investigations in distinct service markets to analyze the unique contributions and capacities of each organizational form, and the transformation of market structure over time. The authors conclude that the dynamic interplay between nonprofit and for-profit forms within markets produces three possible outcomes: stratified, displaced, and defended markets."

Using a grounded theory process centering on the racial composition of Girl Scout troop members and volunteers, this study proposes a two-pronged theory of diversity in voluntary organizations. Building upon Adler and Kwon's three aspects of social capital opportunity, motivation, and ability the study concludes that even when sufficient opportunity and mission-based motivation exists, social capital of the bridging type will likely be insufficient to sustain interactions among diverse members. To remedy this problem, the theory suggests that a voluntary organization can first rely upon the bonding type of social capital to increase representational diversity, then structure mission-relevant interactions among diverse members to create bridging social capital, and sustain pluralistic diversity. New directions for research and practice are also discussed, with the theory indicating that many nonprofits possess characteristics favoring the creation of bridging social capital."

More specifically, it examines two forms of myopia that characterize conceptions of accountability among service-oriented nonprofit organizations: (a) accountability as a set of unconnected binary relationships rather than as a system of relations and (b) accountability as short-term and rule-following behavior rather than as a means to longer-term social change. The article explores the effects of these myopias on a central mechanism of accountability in organizations evaluation and proposes a broader view of accountability that includes organizational learning. Future directions for research and practice are elaborated."

The authors present findings from a major research program that aimed to facilitate the planning of service provision within one faith group, the U.K. Jewish community. The authors outline the opportunities and obstacles found to be facing this Jewish voluntary sector and then discuss the lessons to be drawn from this kind of community-wide approach to the planning of services within and across a faith group in the current public policy climate. Specifically, the authors look at implications for planning in the U.K. Jewish community and other faith groups, for the research agenda on faith-based organizations, and for public and social policy."
392	2005	NVSQ	34:01:00	America Gives: A Survey of Americans' Generosity After September 11	"This article describes a telephone survey (called America Gives) that asked 1,304 randomly selected adults about their philanthropic behavior (giving of time and treasure) after the events of September 11, 2001. The questions were part of a larger national study (n = 4,200) on giving and volunteering that was being conducted at the time of the September 11 attacks. This article provides a brief description of that study, the methodological considerations resulting from the immediate philanthropic response to the September 11 events, and steps that were taken to adapt the study to the changing national conditions. Next, the authors provide descriptive results from the survey, along with multivariate analyses of the determinants of giving and volunteering in this unique situation. Finally, the authors provide some caveats for researchers who may want to assess household giving and volunteering, and discuss implications for nonprofit managers and policy makers."

"A large body of research has examined the effect of government subsidies to nonprofit organizations on philanthropy, with the preponderance of evidence suggesting that government funding partially displaces or crowdsout private giving. Such studies assume that charitable donors are aware of the amount of government funding received by their beneficiary charitable organizations and that they act on this information when determining how much money to donate. This study assesses the validity of these heretofore untested assumptions. After comparing the best guesses of survey respondents (N = 675) to the actual amount of government funding received by the charitable organizations to which they have donated money, the assumption of donors' knowledge about government funding is found to be met only very weakly. Furthermore, few respondents anticipate changing giving behavior due to government subsidies. These findings suggest the need to explore explanations of crowding out beyond those assumed under current theory."
394	2005	NVSQ	34:02:00	State Regulation of Nonprofit Organizations: Accountability Regardless of Outcome	"Although recent calls for increased accountability of the nonprofit sector imply that the role of state regulatory agencies should expand, the costs of expanded regulation to the nonprofit sector and indirectly to the general public and charitable beneficiaries are significant, and should not be ignored. This article examines the motivations that state regulators have in promulgating registration and reporting requirements for nonprofit organizations and professional fund-raisers. Examination of six states with no annual requirements for nonprofit organizations or professional fund-raiser registration and financial reporting revealed no obvious accountability pathologies such as unusually high fraudulent activity or abnormally low donations to nonprofit organizations. Because nonprofit accountability in states without annual registration appears as robust as that in other states, the author proposes removal of state regulations requiring nonprofit annual registration and financial reporting. At the very least, the author urges caution in the face of increasing calls form ore stringent state regulation of nonprofit organizations."
395	2005	NVSQ	34:02:00	"Mixing and Phasing of Roles Among Volunteers, Staff, and Participants in Faith-Based Programs"	"In this grounded theory research project, face-to-face interviews were conducted with program participants, board members, administrators, coordinators, and collaborators in 15 faith-based programs. Findings concerning the roles played by participants, volunteers, and paid staff reveal the wearing of multiple hats, facilitated by a tendency toward cross-training, role diffusion, and doing what is needed. Boundaries created by roles appear to be less important than pragmatically responding to meet human needs. The moral imperative or faith-based nature of the work appears to be a recruiting tool for both paid staff and volunteers, as well as an expressed personal benefit for both. Challenges include turnover among paid staff and volunteers, heavy reliance on volunteers, and low pay. Psychological contracting with a faith-based community may be related to the ability to cope with fluid role expectations and associated ambiguities."
396	2005	NVSQ	34:02:00	"Comparing Faith-Based and Secular Community Service Corporations in Pittsburgh and Allegheny County, Pennsylvania"	"Much of the national dialogue regarding the role of faith-based organizations (FBOs) in social service delivery has focused on congregations that provide various types of services to their communities. Comparatively little attention has been given to FBOs that have incorporated independently as 501(c)3 tax-exempt organizations. This survey of 237 community service organizations in Pittsburgh and Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, finds that a substantial amount of service is provided by agencies that consider themselves to be FBOs, which are comparable to their secular counterparts in many respects, such as size, funding, program capacity, and management sophistication. FBOs appear to be substantially different from secular agencies with respect to their extensive use of volunteers, their relatively low reliance on government funding, and their relatively low engagement in policy advocacy and lobbying."
397	2005	NVSQ	34:02:00	Examining the Landscape of Indiana's Nonprofit Sector: Does What You Know Depend on Where You Look?	"The authors examine technical aspects of surveying nonprofits to determine whether inferences about characteristics of the sector depend on how samples are selected. Using a stratified sample drawn from a comprehensive nonprofit database, they analyze how major profile features of the nonprofit sector vary by sampling source and by how broadly researchers define the sector. The results reveal significant differences in the accuracy, completeness, and response rates associated with alternative sampling sources. Nonprofits found on multiple listings respond at higher rates and are more formalized than those found on only one sampling source, and sampling sources vary in the profiles they generate for the nonprofit sector. The authors conclude that researchers who wish to generalize their findings to the full nonprofit sector should consider the list of incorporated nonprofits as a sampling frame it is among the most efficient and produces the fewest distortions in nonprofit profile features"
398	2005	NVSQ	34:02:00	Government Funding and the Nonprofit Sector: Exploring a New Census Bureau Data SourceThe Federal Audit Clearinghouse	"Using the information provided by the Federal Audit Clearinghouse, maintained by the U.S. Census Bureau, this research attempts to improve our understanding of the nature, scale, extent, and sources of federal funding to social service and educational nonprofit organizations. Using 2001 as the base year, this research is divided into two parts. The first part looks into federal funding provided to social service organizations by laying out the amounts of grants awarded by 57 different federal agencies and looking into its geographic and per capita distribution. The second part traces federal funding provided to universities and provides information on the institutions and states receiving the most grants and the federal agencies that provided them. The data's utility, limitations, and potential uses to academicians and practitioners are also discussed."
399	2005	NVSQ	34:03:00	Serving Up Sermons: Clients' Reactions to Religious Elements at Congregation-Run Feeding Establishments	"The authors use participant observation and interviews with homeless individuals to investigate two questions: How are religious elements that occur in congregation-based food programs integrated into service delivery? How are those elements, especially sermons, perceived by those who eat there? The authors find that regardless of their religious beliefs, two thirds of the homeless respondents reacted negatively to the sermons they heard at congregation-based food programs, characterizing them as coercive, hypocritical, condescending, and conflicting with their own beliefs. Observations at these programs shed light on the source of these negative reactions: The sermons tend to ignore the local knowledge and experience of clients, and they assume that the homeless individuals are responsible for their own troubles."
400	2005	NVSQ	34:03:00	Congregations in Low-Income Neighborhoods and the Implications for Social Welfare Policy Research	"Social scientists have an abundance of information about congregations to inform religion and social welfare policy discussions in the United States. But their data tend to come from congregations located outside low-income neighborhoods, not congregations inside them. This may limit their ability to make definitive claims, especially to policy makers, about social welfare practices and the potential of congregations located in low-income neighborhoods to aid in poverty reduction initiatives. Are the literature's findings about social service provisions by congregations applicable to congregations located in poor places? Using a data set of congregations located in the vicinity of public housing complexes in four cities, the authors explore this question. In the process, they discern factors that influence social service provisions by congregations located in low-income neighborhoods, identifying congregation income, clergy education, and congregation residency as the most significant predictors of social service activity. The authors conclude by identifying future research directions."
401	2005	NVSQ	34:03:00	"Understanding Collaboration Among Nonprofit Organizations: Combining Resource Dependency, Institutional, and Network Perspectives"	"Existing research stops short of explaining why nonprofit organizations develop certain forms of collaborations instead of others. In this article, the authors combine resource dependency, institutional, and network theories to examine the factors that influence the likelihood that nonprofit organizations develop formal types of collaborative activities vis-ö-vis informal types. Based on the survey data of 95 urban charitable organizations, the study has found that an organization is more likely to increase the degree of formality of its collaborative activities when it is older, has a larger budget size, receives government funding but relies on fewer government funding streams, has more board linkages with other nonprofit organizations, and is not operating in the education and research or social service industry."
402	2005	NVSQ	34:03:00	Doing Syringe Exchange: Organizational Transformation and Volunteer Commitment	"The authors examine the organizational transformation of Prevention Point, the San Francisco-based syringe exchange program. Their purposes are to explore the processes of organizational change, focus on the impact of formalization on members and organizational goals, and contextualize these in light of belonging to an underground organization. They highlight the volunteers' motivation and commitment, and their responses to the organizational changes. Drawing on qualitative interviews with 56 service providers, conducted from 1993 to 1995, the authors document the changes in the organization and the members' perceptions of it as it moved from an illegal, deviant group to a socially sanctioned service organization. This transition is shown to have ultimately undermined much of the basis for volunteer commitment, reinforcing the shift in responsibility from the membership to a new management structure. These findings have implications for the larger problem of maintaining volunteer engagement in volunteer work"
403	2005	NVSQ	34:03:00	Why Get Involved? Reasons for Voluntary-Association Activity Among Americans and Canadians	"Using national representative sample survey data from the United States and Canada, the authors compare American and Canadian responses to a set of 14 possible reasons for being active in voluntary associations. They assess the 14 reasons individually and then conduct analyses in which the 14 measures are grouped into two composite scales: collective reasons and self-oriented motivations. The authors also consider theories for explaining how and why Americans and Canadians might differ in their motivations for volunteering. Analyses are conducted on seven background predictors: gender, race, religious affiliation, religious attendance, age, education, and socioeconomic status. Findings show that Americans are more likely than Canadians to mention altruistic rather than personal reasons for joining voluntary organizations, and Canadians are slightly more likely than Americans to emphasize personal reasons for their volunteer work, but this difference is not significant after controls. The implications of the findings for understanding voluntary activity in the two nations are discussed."
404	2005	NVSQ	34:04:00	The Impact of Receiving a Master's Degree in Nonprofit Management on Graduates' Professional Lives	"This article reports on a study of the outcomes of receiving a specialized master's degree in nonprofit management as perceived by graduates of three such programs in the United States. A literature search was conducted to identify outcomes that nonprofit management education should provide, and a questionnaire based on the literature was developed. The questionnaire was mailed to 645 graduates of three master's degree programs in nonprofit management, total response rate was 65%. Results indicated an overall positive perception of the outcomes of the program. This was true regardless of the length of time since respondents had graduated and the number of years they had worked in the nonprofit sector. Responses to an open-ended question regarding graduates' satisfaction with the degree were predominantly positive, but negative comments suggest areas where programs could be improved. The implications of the study's findings for the field of nonprofit management education are discussed."
405	2005	NVSQ	34:04:00	Funding Good Works: Funding Sources of Faith-Based Social Service Coalitions	"Data from the first national study of faith-based social service coalitions ( n = 656) are used to achieve three goals. First, the authors describe their myriad funding sources. Second, they discuss their attitudes toward three major ones: government, foundations, and congregations. Third, they analyze organizational characteristics that correlate with funding sources. Given a paucity of empirical literature on faith-based agencies, the authors depend heavily on that pertaining to secular nonprofits to identify 13 predictor variables that might be related to two funding measures (logged dollars and budget percentage) for each of the four most important funding sources: government, foundations, religious organizations, and individual donors. Predictor variables fall into three clusters: attitudes toward funding source, organizational religiosity, and organizational structural features and activities. The complex findings indicate that dollar amounts and budget percentages are associated with predictor variables in different ways, depending on the source of funds."
406	2005	NVSQ	34:04:00	Nonprofits and the Job Retention of Former Welfare Clients	"Legislation has shifted power and authority for welfare policies and programs to the states, with few federal guidelines. However, the intent was clearly to move people from welfare to work. Nonprofit organizations have played a major role in providing jobs for this population, along with the public and for-profit sectors. A critical issue is what nonprofits and other employers, through their human resource (HR) practices, can do to enhance the job retention of former welfare clients. The authors conducted a large-scale empirical study that examined effects of a broad range of HR practices associated with the retention of welfare clients in the nonprofit, for-profit, and public sectors. Results indicate that job retention is higher in the nonprofit sector compared to the others, and that this retention may be a result of HR practices that emphasize investment in and commitment to employees. Implications for public policy are also presented."
407	2005	NVSQ	34:04:00	The Demand for Volunteer Labor: A Study of Hospital Volunteers	"The authors challenge the assumption that organizations are willing to use all the volunteer labor available to them. Rather, they are influenced by the costs incurred of utilizing volunteer labor. This article provides a modest first look at the demand for volunteers by nonprofit institutions. Specifically, the article presents an economic analysis of the demand of volunteer labor by hospitals in the Toronto area and examines some of the factors that may determine the hospitals' willingness to use volunteer labor. Using data generated from 28 hospitals in Toronto, which use a total of more than 2 million volunteer hr per year, the authors show that the quantity of volunteer hours demanded is a decreasing function of their costs. Other factors such as productivity, output, and labor market institutions also influence the demand for volunteers."
408	2005	NVSQ	34:04:00	Are They Here for the Long Haul? The Effects of Functional Motives and Personality Factors on the Psychological Contracts of Volunteers	"In this article, the author discusses the concepts of the psychological contract, functional motivation, and the five-factor model of personality and explains how these should relate to one another when anticipating volunteer preferences. Two studies are presented: In the first he applied the psychological contract and the volunteer functional inventory to a sample of volunteer firefighters, in the second he applied the psychological contract, the volunteer functional inventory, and the five-factor model of personality to a sample of students volunteering for various student and community groups. No relationships were found in Study1 between functional motives and psychological contract type. In Study 2, the personality dimensions of agreeableness and emotional stability were found to relate to the relational psychological contract. Career motives, and the personality factor of conscientiousness, were related to transactional psychological contracts. The implications for these findings are discussed"
409	2005	NVSQ	34:04:00	Building Ethical Capacity for Collaborative Research	"Researchers collaborate for a number of reasons: clarify questions, sharpen arguments, influence practice, and many others. That said, collaborations especially those that go beyond parallel writing on a single topic bring normative frameworks into conflict. Values infuse the voluntary sector, nonprofit organizations, and our research on both, yet it is far from clear how we go about managing normative claims as a positive resource. This article discusses a process for developing moral pluralism into ethical capacity that advances collaborative work. The process consists of three cumulative stages: diagnosis, description, and mutual accommodation. The ethical capacity generated in these stages is not extrinsic but internal to collaboration. It allows us to develop and sustain the intellectual spaces in which assets and limitations interact to create knowledge that cannot be created by individuals working alone."
410	2006	NVSQ	35:01:00	A Study of Organizational Effectiveness for National Olympic Sporting Organizations	"This study applies the competing values approach (CVA) of organizational effectiveness to a sample of nonprofit Australian national Olympic sporting organizations (NOSOs). The purpose of the study was to determine the psychometric properties of the subscales developed within each of the four quadrants composing the CVA. Two hundred eighty-nine constituents from 10 NOSOs participated in this study. Initial factor analysis resulted in six of the eight theoretically derived cells in the CVA each yielding one reliable factor. These were Flexibility, Resources, Planning, Productivity, Availability of Information, and Stability. The other two cells, Skilled Workforce and Cohesive Workforce, each produced a two-factor structure. To understand the relationship between these manifest factors (cells) and organizational effectiveness, a confirmatory factor analysis was conducted, which revealed that the rational-goal model, comprising Productivity and Planning, was the critical determinant of effectiveness in NOSOs."
411	2006	NVSQ	35:01:00	Communalities and Distinctions in the Measurement of Organizational Performance and Effectiveness Across For-Profit and Nonprofit Sectors	"The article analyzes the way academic scholarly works measure organizational outcomes, commonly reported as either organizational effectiveness or organizational performance (OEP). From the analysis of 149 scholarly publications published in the past decade, focusing on business organizations (100), on nonprofit organizations (21), and a mix of both (28), a set of criteria emerged. Overlapping common ground issues found for all the sectors include (a) efficiency and/or productivity, (b) growth and/or market share, (c) customer orientation, and (d) quality. Further measures (e.g., public image and/or reputation, social performance) fit specific sectors. A multivariate analysis showed three and two configurations of criteria for business and not-for-profit research, respectively. Results suggest a set of accepted, multidimensional, and universal criteria for measuring OEP. In choosing criteria for future studies, we recommend adopting such common ground, backed up by specific criteria when a certain sector is unique, to reflect convergence and divergence in OEP research."
412	2006	NVSQ	35:01:00	Capacity Building Through Partnership: Intermediary Nongovernmental Organizations as Local and Global Actors	"Partnership and capacity building have become popular strategies among intermediary nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Partnership is viewed as a cure for centrally managed bureaucratic NGOs and capacity building as a measure for strengthening local NGOs. This article examines the case of an intermediary NGO that followed a unique strategy combining capacity building through partnership. Through this, it reveals the trade-offs involved in the choice of an appropriate governance structure. It was found that although the decentralized network form of governance proved to be a powerful innovation, it presented a paradox. Especially in this case where the goal was transmission of specific values and perspectives about sustainable development, such a strategy posed a complex set of trade-offs. Drawing from the experience of this organization, the author suggests that a plural form organization may provide maximum governance efficiency for intermediary NGOs like the one examined here. These insights may also apply to social movement organizations."
413	2006	NVSQ	35:01:00	Men's and Women's Volunteering: Gender Differences in the Effects of Employment and Family Characteristics	"This study focuses on gender differences in the effects of employment and family characteristics on volunteering among White adults using data from the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) 1995-1996. There is a statistically significant difference in the way employment status affects men's and women's volunteering behavior. Relative to full-time employment, part-time employment encourages women's volunteer work but not men's, while unemployment exclusively inhibits men's volunteering. A significant gender difference is also in the effect of elderly care. Only among women is the time spent on elderly care significantly and negatively associated with volunteering. Women typically spend more time providing unpaid care to aging family members, and this will further contribute to the gender gap in volunteering among family caregivers to the elderly. Implications of these and related findings for volunteer work organizations are discussed."
414	2006	NVSQ	35:01:00	The Strategic Choices of Child Advocacy Groups	"Public interest groups have many strategic options, including insider strategies,  outsider strategies, coalition building, and public policy research. Although group resources should affect these strategic choices, the presence of friends and enemies in the political environment should matter as well. We examine the evidence by assessing the behavior of 50 child advocacy groups that seek to influence public policy at the state level. We find that enemies motivate public interest groups more than friends but that friends also matter, at least for decisions to invest in public policy research."
415	2006	NVSQ	35:01:00	Charity for Profit? Exploring Factors Associated with the Commercialization of Human Service Nonprofits	"Human service nonprofits are becoming increasingly involved with selling services and other commercial activities. There has been a debate about the advantages and disadvantages of the transition of human service nonprofits. A path model was constructed to understand factors associated with the commercialization of human service nonprofits. The model was tested using the data collected from 67 human service nonprofits. The model showed an overall statistical fit. It was found that commercial revenues were negatively associated with donative revenues. Higher levels of commercial income can significantly contribute to an organization's self-sufficiency, ability to attract and retain staff, and reputation. However, commercial revenues do not make a significant contribution to the organization's ability to attract donors and volunteers, mission, and service delivery when the effects of other variables are controlled for. Limitations of the data and methodology used for this study are discussed and suggestions for future research are provided."
416	2006	NVSQ	35:02:00	Constructing Civil Society: Citizen Associations in Israel in the 1950s	"Following Michael Walzer's civil society argument, this article examines the primary relationship that developed between the Israeli government and citizen associations during Israel's first years of independence. The article describes the role that citizen associations played in advancing an open discussion about the right of association within the context of a young, inexperienced democracy. The desire for freedom of association on the part of Israel's citizens challenged the government's tendency to restrict this right and played a key role in defining the limits of government intervention in the individual's affairs. The research offers a different approach to the democratic effects of associations and shows that initiative to establish new associations, and an open discussion of their legal framework, should be considered as part of the democratization process in a new state."
417	2006	NVSQ	35:02:00	The Larger They Get: The Changing Size Distributions of Private Human Service Organizations	"Although systematic studies on trends in the size distributions of private human service organizations do not exist, most observers assume that the dominant trend parallels that of the U.S. economy's movement to a higher proportion of smaller organizations. This article investigates this assumption and finds evidence that calls its validity into question. Explanations of the trend to larger organizations are offered, and it is suggested that more attention needs to be given to the repercussions of the presence in the private human services sector of higher numbers of large organizations."
418	2006	NVSQ	35:02:00	Nonprofit Fund-Raising in Competitive Donor Markets	"Fundraising expenditures represent an important strategic decision for nonprofit managers in the face of scarce or no resources. Privately, nonprofit managers weigh the trade-off between reaching new donors and increasing the implicit price of output to its constituents. Socially, competition among nonprofit firms for donations may produce an excessive level of fund-raising. This article empirically examines nonprofit fund-raising decisions, privately and socially, under varying market conditions. Analysis of financial data reveals that as markets become more competitive, nonprofits follow their private incentives by reducing their fund-raising expenditures. However, the author finds evidence that, collectively, nonprofits may spend an inefficiently high share of their revenues on fund-raising. As such, the author offers alternatives to the common practice of collective fund-raising through institutions such as the United Way. Implications of the study include increasing price transparency to improve market discipline or raising legal and financial barriers to entry."
419	2006	NVSQ	35:02:00	"Worker Motivations, Job Satisfaction, and Loyalty in Public and Nonprofit Social Services"	"Exploiting a unique data set created in 1999 on a sample of 228 public, nonprofit, and for-profit organizations operating in the social service sector, and on 2,066 workers, the article tests whether workers' satisfaction and loyalty to the organization is influenced by workers' motivations and by the incentive mixes offered by different organizational forms. As for satisfaction, intrinsic and relational attitudes toward work exert the greatest influence, whereas workers motivated by economic interests are less satisfied. As for loyalty to the organization, satisfaction with economic and process-related aspects of the job appear to have the greatest impact. The behavior of nonprofit organizations, which form the largest part of the sample, is consistent with these results. The specific strength of their incentive mix is represented by worker involvement and other process-related aspects of the job. By contrast, workers in public bodies are the least satisfied, higher monetary incentives notwithstanding."
420	2006	NVSQ	35:02:00	Giving and Volunteering as Distinct Forms of Civic Engagement: The Role of Community Integration and Personal Resources in Formal Helping	"Despite the debate over the value of giving versus volunteering and the implications that they may be connected to public life in distinct ways, there is little work that compares how factors related to civic engagement may encourage greater volunteering and greater charitable giving in different ways. Moreover, there is a need for a theoretical framework to understand why these helping behaviors relate differently to civic engagement when placed in the context of social ties and community participation. Using data from The Survey of Giving and Volunteering in the United States, the author finds that greater volunteering is most strongly promoted by community ties and increased giving is best explained by personal resources and helping values. As a result, the author argues that giving and volunteering represent distinct means of engagement and the potential substitution of money for time in formal helping has important implications for the civic life."
421	2006	NVSQ	35:02:00	Community Foundation Performance: Bridging Community Resources and Needs	"This study draws on organizational ecology perspective to explore the environmental and organizational factors associated with the performance of community foundations. Performance was conceptualized as fiscal efficiency and grant-making performance. Analysis was conducted on a national survey of 117 community foundations. Results revealed that increased organizational density was positively associated with fiscal efficiency but negatively associated to grant-making performance. Specialist foundations (i.e., foundations that serve a smaller sized community and those with smaller asset size) outperformed their generalist counterparts in fiscal efficiency and grant-making performance. The percentage of unrestricted funds was negatively associated with fiscal efficiency but not grant-making generosity. Board performance was positively associated with fiscal efficiency but not grant-making generosity"
422	2006	NVSQ	35:02:00	Should Donors Care About Overhead Costs? Do They Care?	"This article reports on a theory-based experiment to determine whether there is an observable relationship between changes in charitable giving to an organization and changes in the proportion of revenue it spends on administration and fund-raising (overhead ratio). This article argues that overhead ratios are meaningless for comparing organizations, but changes in overhead ratios communicate useful, though incomplete, information to donors. Empirical studies have used organization-level data with mixed results. This research improves on past work by using donor-level information on federal employees in the Chicago area who donate through the Combined Federal Campaign with ready access to information on the overhead ratios of all participating charities. Donations are aggregated by charity and compared over time. Statistical tests give evidence of an inverse relationship between changes in overhead ratios and changes in giving that are robust with respect to model specification, however, collectively other factors are much more important."
423	2006	NVSQ	35:02:00	Nonprofits as Social Capital and Agents in the Public Policy Process: Toward a New Paradigm	"This article explores a new, universal, and theoretically inclusive approach to understanding the performance and purpose of nonprofit organizations in today's world. This approach envisions the nonprofit organization as a social capital asset and agent in a specific relationship to the public. This relationship is depicted in a principal-agent paradigm and the performance is in the public policy process. The public policy arena is the nonprofit's analogy of the firm's marketplace. Nonprofits do more than fill in for market or government failures. They also regulate, facilitate, assist, and modify markets and play a significant role in every aspect of public policy, that is, from determining party platforms to the implementation of policies. In the public policy process, they have a comparative advantage as agents of citizens and firms"

The authors argue that the series framed the conservancy's activities in accord with a meta narrative or story that may be reduced to the fable of The Prince and the Pauper. Because The Post depicted TNC's actions in this light in its front-page stories, the conservation organization had little strategic choice but to accept that characterization and to plead that it would do better in the future. Reality, however, was much more complex than this reductionist accounting suggested. The authors explore the social and political impact of The Post articles and their assumptions concerning organizational and democratic accountability as well as their implications for the potential for organizational learning and for public policy agenda-setting dynamics."
425	2006	NVSQ	35:03:00	The Effects of Volunteering for Nonprofit Organizations on Social Capital Formation: Evidence from a Statewide Survey	"As membership in civic organizations declines in the United States, could volunteering for nonprofit organizations be an alternative source of social capital formation? After theoretically connecting volunteering with social capital using a household production framework, the authors then use a unique data set from Vermont to estimate the determinants of the probability of receiving a social capital benefit and the level of such a benefit. The probability of receiving a social capital benefit from one's most important nonprofit organization is increased: (a) if it is a religious or social service organization, (b) if one increases their volunteering for the organization, and (c) if one is female, college educated, or in a two-parent family. However, the relative magnitude of volunteering is similar, or relatively small, compared to the other significant determinants. An increase of volunteer hours does increase levels of social capital, however, the magnitude of this effect is also relatively small."

In this study the authors work with three large nonprofits operating bequest societies and using direct marketing to solicit gifts from across their fund-raising database. They compare the profiles of their bequest pledgers with nonpledgers to determine whether individuals willing to offer a bequest may be demographically or attitudinally distinct. Developing a discriminant function they correctly classify 77.1% of 624 respondents to a postal survey of 3,000 donors and/or pledgers. Legacy pledgers appear significantly more likely to be seeking a means of reciprocation, are more concerned that the organization be performing well, and are more concerned with the quality of communications they receive. The fund-raising implications of their analysis are explored."
427	2006	NVSQ	35:03:00	"Philanthropic Strategies in Place-Based, Collaborative Land Conservation: The Packard Foundation's Conserving California Landscape Initiative"	"The Packard Foundation's Conserving California Landscape Initiative (CCLI), a US $175 million 5-year (1998-2003) program intended to conserve 250,000 acres of open space in three regions in California, exemplifies the potential contribution and pitfalls of a private foundation's engagement in contemporary place-based, collaborative conservation. The achievements and limitations of this philanthropic effort are revealed largely through interviews of program officers, grantees, and public officials. Focusing conservation in three regions of the state, employing deliberate grant leveraging, promoting conservation partnerships, approaching conservation on multiple fronts, and building nonprofit capacities, CCLI preserved more than 300,000 acres of land, generated around $700 million in matching funds, raised the profile of conservation in the state and local communities agenda, and fostered collaboration among diverse publics. However positive, CCLI efforts inevitably raised broader governance issues transparency and accountability, agenda setting and representation, donor power and grantees autonomy related to the enlarged role of private money in public conservation."

The outcome indicated that devolution and privatization were promoted through LTCI although the central government maintained control. This article identified the underlying forces that made the Japanese experience of devolution and privatization unique: the history of the government-private relationship, the dilemma between decentralization and the issue of equity, and the centralized system as the driving force of organizational isomorphism. The challenges and opportunities faced by Japanese nonprofit organizations are discussed based on the findings, as well as the influence of for-profit organizations in the examined area."
429	2006	NVSQ	35:03:00	Market Orientations in the Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector: A Meta-Analysis of Their Relationships With Organizational Performance	"In their effort to improve performance, many voluntary and nonprofit organizations (VNPOs) have turned to market mechanisms, hoping to learn and implement innovative ideas and methods that proved useful in the private sector. This article adopts the businesslike concept of marketing into the arena of VNPOs by offering a meta-analysis to assess the marketing orientation (MO) in the VNPO sector. The article attempts to answer three questions: (a) What is the theoretical grounding and rationality for using MO strategies in the VNPO sector? (b) Can the VNPO sector benefit from an MO approach? (c) Is the MO perspective applicable for organizations without profit as a main goal? The findings were compared with findings in the for-profit sector and were found to be stronger. Finally, using a second, methodological meta-analysis, boundary conditions on the MO-performance link were assessed. The implications for VNPOs are discussed and directions for future research are outlined."

Exploring the moral biography of wealth highlights the philosophical foundations of major gifts by major donors. First, the author provides several examples to elucidate his definition of moral biography. Second, he elaborates the elements of a moral biography. Third, he describes the characteristics that make one's moral biography a spiritual or religious biography. Fourth, he discusses the distinctive characteristics of a moral biography of wealth. Fifth, he suggests that implementing a process of discernment will enable development professionals to work more productively with donors. The author concludes by placing the notion of a moral biography of wealth in historical context and suggests how advancement professionals can deepen their own moral biography by working to deepen the moral biography of their donors."
431	2006	NVSQ	35:03:00	A Conceptual Model Exploring the Dynamics of Government Nonprofit Service Delivery	"This article explores the dynamics between government and human service nonprofits for service delivery in the United States. The authors initiate the development of a dynamic resource theory to explain the process of government nonprofit interdependence for human service delivery. The theory is conceived from the application of system dynamics to dependencies arising through the process of resource exchange. They explain how government regulations can help to improve or to lower the quality of service and how the balance of power between government and nonprofits shifts over time. Elaboration, refinement, and testing of dynamic resource theory will improve our ability to manage and benefit from the government nonprofit partnership."
432	2006	NVSQ	35:03:00	Foundation Approaches to Effectiveness: A Typology	"The heterogeneity of foundations is usually captured in terms of classifications based on size or type (community, corporate, independent). This article argues that to capture broader elements of foundation approaches to philanthropy, we also need ways of categorizing foundations that reflect differences in how they approach their work and the underlying philosophies that inform their philanthropy. The article develops one such typology, drawing on research on 1,192 foundations. The typology is proposed as useful for understanding variations among foundations, and for its practical value in helping foundations clarify their own guiding frameworks."
433	2006	NVSQ	35:03:00	Giving Circles: Growing Grassroots Philanthropy	"Giving circles entail individuals pooling money and other resources and then deciding together where to give these away. More than this, they educate members about community issues, engage members in voluntary efforts, provide social opportunities, and maintain independence from any particular charity. This article reports on an exploratory study of giving circles in the United States, addressing the questions: What are giving circles and their impacts and how are they unique to the new philanthropy environment? The article concludes by discussing the implications of the giving circle movement for philanthropic and nonprofit professionals."
434	2006	NVSQ	35:03:00	"To Give or Not to Give, That Is the Question: How Methodology Is Destiny in Dutch Giving Data"	"In research on giving, methodology is destiny. The volume of donations estimated from sample surveys strongly depends on the length of the questionnaire used to measure giving. By comparing two giving surveys from the Netherlands, the authors show that a short questionnaire on giving not only underestimates the volume of giving but also biases the effects of predictors of giving. Specifically, they find that a very short module leads to an underestimation of the effects of predictors of giving on the amount donated but an overestimation of their effects on the probability of charitable giving. Short survey modules may lead researchers to falsely reject or accept hypotheses on determinants of giving due to underreporting of donations."
435	2006	NVSQ	35:04:00	"The Effects of Race, Gender, and Marital Status on Giving and Volunteering in Indiana"	"The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of race, gender, and marital status on giving and volunteering behavior. A second purpose is to examine these effects across different survey methodologies. Using data from Indiana households, a multimethod, multigroup research design was used to compare giving and volunteering across eight different survey methodologies. Results indicate important differences in philanthropic behaviors by gender, race, marital status, and survey methodology even when controlling for differences in income, age, and educational attainment. These results highlight the importance of looking specifically at human and social capital variables, and survey methodology, when making assumptions about and interpreting the measurement of philanthropic behavior."

The authors study how the donors' structure and board of trustees relates to organizational efficiency. Results show that the presence of an active institutional donor provides a control mechanism for these NGDOs, thus favoring the efficient allocation of resources, and that the structure of the board of trustees is irrelevant in this respect. Results are robust to alternative measures of technical and allocative efficiency"
437	2006	NVSQ	35:04:00	"Community Foundations, Organizational Strategy, and Public Policy"	"This empirical study of the strategic direction of California community foundations explores how this choice is affected by organizational and community characteristics and by external forces. The authors develop a model of the determinants of organizational strategy in community foundations and analyze it based on interviews and on data collected on community foundations and their communities. They then consider the implications for public policy. Strategic choice was found to be affected by organization age, community stability, the professionalization of the field, and the growth in national competitors. They also consider the implications of these results for recent changes in local governance. Community foundations that have been established for some time and those located in communities that are stable are the ones that appear best positioned to enhance the problem-solving capacity of communities."
438	2006	NVSQ	35:04:00	Comparative Performance and Quality Among Nonprofit Nursing Facilities in Texas	"Researchers have given little attention to relative economic efficiency among nonprofit nursing facilities. Presumably, religious-affiliated, government, and private secular nonprofit facilities pursue similar objectives, perform similarly, and receive tax exemptions accordingly. Using modified, translog cost-and profit-function regression analyses, this article rejects the hypothesis of homogeneous performance. In Texas, private secular nonprofit nursing homes are the most cost-efficient, followed by religious-affiliated and then government nursing facilities. When allocation efficiency is also considered, government and private secular facilities have similar overall economic efficiency, religious-affiliated and government facilities are similar as well, however, private secular facilities are significantly more efficient than religious-affiliated homes. Quality appears to be homogeneous among facility classifications. Given these significant differences, policy makers may want to consider the role of relative economic performance when granting nonprofit status to nursing facilities because nonprofit governance boards may allow their organizations to pursue the socially superior goal somewhat divergently."
439	2006	NVSQ	35:04:00	How the Private Food Assistance Network Evolved: Interactions between Public and Private Responses to Hunger	"Delivery of assistance to the poor in the United States has changed drastically in the past 25 years. Although the availability of cash assistance has narrowed, the availability of food assistance has broadened. The most substantial change in assistance available to the poor has been the emergence of food pantries as a source of free food to prepare at home, which happened almost concurrent to changes in the operation of the Food Stamp Program. The authors argue that the cessation of the Food Stamp Program's buy-in requirement contributed to a chronic demand for private food assistance and that, in many respects, private food assistance substitutes for an inadequate public food safety net. The authors conclude with recommendations for strengthening the domestic food safety net."
440	2006	NVSQ	35:04:00	Advocacy Organizations and the Field of Youth Services: Ongoing Efforts to Restructure a Field	"The field of youth services has undergone many changes in the past few decades, and advocacy organizations play a pivotal role in reconceptualizing this field by promoting better and more coordinated services to youth in need. This article examines how advocacy organizations bring about new conceptions of youth, influence the organization of the field, and ultimately change the way public policy addresses youth's needs. The authors first describe the field of youth services, a highly fragmented field that has historically focused on youth as problems and targets for intervention. Next, they describe the current reform movement that instead promotes positive youth development. Focusing on the concept of restructuration, they then highlight some of the ways in which three advocacy organizations in San Francisco and Oakland, California, influence the field, and they propose early indicators that suggest how this field is being reorganized."
441	2006	NVSQ	35:04:00	Who's Watching Us Now? The Nonprofit Sector and the New Government by Surveillance	"This article addresses the increasing use by the public sector of compliance monitoring and surveillance as modes of governance and the potential impact of it on the nonprofit sector. The article traces the origins of this shift in public sector governance to major events in the early 21st century, such as 9/11 and the corporate accountability scandals. The ramifications for nonprofit organizations are described, including more rigid reporting requirements, diminished capacity to innovate, and potential wariness of engaging in public policy. There are a number of ways for the sector to adapt to these changes. Closer collaboration with the business sector that is also being affected by the more stringent regulatory environment would help to broaden the message of nonprofits. Foundation support of advocacy and strategic communications would also assist the nonprofit sector in collaborating productively with government."
442	2006	NVSQ	35:04:00	Charitable Giving: Factors Influencing Giving in U.S. States	"Charitable giving by households in the United States is significant. More than two thirds of households self-report giving. Private giving represents more than 2% of total gross domestic product (GDP) and is a significant factor in funding the nonprofit sector. This research note documents giving across U.S. states. It adds detailed data and analysis supporting and supplementing research that identifies personal income, capital gains, religious group affiliation, age, volunteerism, and educational attainment as the main factors affecting household giving."
443	2007	NVSQ	36:01:00	"Politics, Policy, and the Motivations for Advocacy in Nonprofit Reproductive Health and Family Planning Providers"	"Despite the important symbolic and substantive benefits of political activity by nonprofit organizations, recent evidence suggests that a relatively limited number of charities actively advocate. The existing literature on nonprofit advocacy adequately explains why so few charities are actively political, however, it fails to illuminate the reasons why some individual charities choose to advocate despite documented constraints. This article offers an alternative to existing explanations for nonprofit advocacy that focuses on the causes for, and the constraints on, this behavior. It suggests that nonprofit organizations are more likely to be politically active when public policies restrict their ability to deliver core services, and when the probability of success is highest because of the presence of political allies. Analyses of advocacy behavior in more than 450 501(c)(3) organizations suggest that these factors persist as motivators of political activity even after controlling for the dominant constraints suggested in the literature."
444	2007	NVSQ	36:01:00	The Debate Regarding the Better Business Bureau's Commitment to Neutrality: An Analysis of Local Better Business Bureau Boards of Directors	"The Better Business Bureau (BBB) states that it is a neutral party striving to serve equally the interests of both businesses and consumers. However, critics have alleged that the BBB's policies and practices are biased in favor of businesses. This study analyzes the composition of the boards of directors of local BBB offices. Using resource-dependency theory, arguments are advanced to explain why the BBB may be more inclined to have board members from business backgrounds rather than board members who are community influentials (e.g., executives with nonprofit organizations and charities, academicians, and government employees). Results show that the vast majority of BBB board members are businesspeople from industries that generate large numbers of BBB consumer complaints. Discussion focuses on the implications of these findings for the credibility and legitimacy of the BBB as a representative of consumer interests in the marketplace."
445	2007	NVSQ	36:01:00	When is Administrative Efficiency Associated With Charitable Donations?	"Whether accounting measures of administrative efficiency affect donations is an important issue for nonprofit managers. Prior research is inconclusive. Some studies find a significant negative relation, whereas others find no significant relation. The authors investigate a variety of reasons for the prior divergent results. The evidence is consistent with donors reducing contributions to organizations reporting higher administrative expense ratios when the ratios are presumably most relevant and reliable. The authors suggest that certain prior studies failed to find significant associations largely because their samples contained many organizations for which the administrative ratios were unreliable or not helpful for donor needs. Model specification issues also affect prior studies but are less critical than sample composition. When the authors replicate prior studies on samples containing established, donation-dependent organizations with nontrivial amounts of fund-raising and administrative expenses, they generally detect a significant negative association."
446	2007	NVSQ	36:01:00	The Quality and Comparability of Survey Data on Charitable Giving	"This article examines six major household surveys of charitable giving and attempts to trace differences in estimates to underlying differences in survey methodology. The main result is that surveys that cue respondent recall by directing attention to charities' outputs and use interviewers experienced in obtaining information about dollar amounts measure larger amounts of giving. Even so, it is very difficult to estimate giving at the top of the distribution without a high-income oversample: Only one of the surveys not containing a high-income oversample produces estimates around the 90th percentile similar to that obtained with a high-income oversample."
447	2007	NVSQ	36:01:00	Social Capital and Philanthropy: An Analysis of the Impact of Social Capital on Individual Giving and Volunteering	"This article examines the impact of social capital on philanthropy. Based on extensive information on individuals' embeddedness in various dimensions of social capital gathered in the Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey, two measures of social capital are extracted from the data via factor analysis. One relates to individuals' associational networks, the second relates to their trust in others and in their community. These measures are then incorporated into models of religious giving, secular giving, and volunteering. The estimates confirm the importance of social capital in explaining the generosity of individuals. When social capital is included in giving equations, the direct influences of human capital (education) and religiosity fall, raising the question of whether previous understanding of their importance as determinants of giving and volunteering was overstated or, alternatively, whether the extent to which religion and education foster personal philanthropy by fostering associational networks and norms of trust and cooperation has been under-appreciated."
448	2007	NVSQ	36:01:00	"Members, Volunteers, and Donors in Nonprofit Organizations in Spain"	"In general terms, participation in nonprofit organizations (NPOs) generates social benefits, raising human capital through the transfer of knowledge and interpersonal trust through the interaction of NPO members while at the same time encouraging political involvement. People's relations with NPOs take a variety of forms: The authors could distinguish members, participants, donors, and volunteers. In this article, the authors examine the personal decision to become involved in or collaborate with an NPO from a general approach: (a) What is the relationship between the decisions to participate, become a member, make donations, and become a volunteer? (b) Are there any differences between the various types of NPOs? and (c) Is there any relationship between the relative income inequality of the Spanish regions and the level of citizen collaboration?"
449	2007	NVSQ	36:01:00	Toward an Empirical Characterization of Bridging and Bonding Social Capital	"Though a vast amount of empirical work stresses the beneficial effects of social capital, the recent literature has explicitly recognized the importance of distinguishing different types of social capital. Particularly, a distinction has been made between homogeneous (or bonding) and heterogeneous (or bridging) networks under the argument that the latter are more likely to generate positive externalities than the former. The empirical operationalization of this theoretical distinction has thus far, however, remained underdeveloped. The authors take a step to resolve this issue by assessing the diversity of (voluntary) association membership on a number of socioeconomic traits. The proposed methodology is applied to Flemish survey data on voluntary association membership. This analysis indicates that hobby clubs and humanitarian associations such as the Red Cross are among the most bridging associations, whereas women's groups and associations for retired people are among the most bonding groups."
450	2007	NVSQ	36:01:00	Does Executive Intuition Matter? An Empirical Analysis of Its Relationship With Nonprofit Organization Financial Performance	"This study tests the relationship between a chief executive's intuitive decision style and financial measures of nonprofit organization performance. Providing additional support for earlier theories that emphasized top managers' ability to influence change in their organizations, executive intuition was found to be significantly associated with three of the six financial performance outcomes examined in this study. Executive intuition was a significant and positive predictor of both fiscal performance measures and one of two public support measures. Implications and future research ideas are offered."
451	2007	NVSQ	36:01:00	The Ingredients of Financial Transparency	"The demand for financial accountability by nonprofit organizations has dramatically increased. This includes church organizations that historically have not been very forthcoming or transparent with financial reports. This article examines the practices employed by the Archdiocese of Boston, which released a groundbreaking report in the spring of 2006. This was a multifaceted communications project that provided meaningful financial information to a broad group of stakeholders. In recent years, many of these stakeholders had been critical of the archdiocesan leadership for its lack of accountability. This report substantively answered the questions of all the stakeholder groups, winning high praise for its clarity and conciseness. The article highlights the key lessons learned in the process and how they might be applied to other church organizations."
452	2007	NVSQ	36:01:00	Regional Wealth and Philanthropic Capacity Mapping	"Since 1975, wealth distribution in the United States has grown markedly more disparate, with a larger concentration of the country's personal wealth owned by a smaller fraction of the population. Personal wealth is an important determinant in economic well-being yet is often ignored in studies of personal finances because wealth data are difficult to collect. This article introduces techniques for analyzing wealth and philanthropic capacity on a regional scale, showing how to pinpoint regions of high wealth and philanthropic capacity for county and Census block group regions. Results show how state and county measures mask large subcounty differences in financial well-being and potential for philanthropy among residents. In essence, the article introduces a new approach to economic development via targeted regional initiatives in asset retention and philanthropy."
453	2007	NVSQ	36:02:00	Governance for Broadened Accountability: Blending Deliberate and Emergent Strategizing	"The nonprofit sector is challenged by increasing public and stakeholder demands for a broadened accountability. Strong expectations for performance accountability now accompany those for fiscal accountability. In response, better concepts of nonprofit accountability are being developed in the literature. However, knowledge of governance practices that can achieve broadened accountability has lagged. This article attempts to stimulate research and contribute to such knowledge by (a) synthesizing concepts of accountability presented by Behn (2001), Kearns (1996), and Boland and Schultze (1996) into two categories: rule-based and negotiable accountability, (b) developing grounded concepts concerning the practice of governance by nonprofit leaders, and (c) exploring the interrelationships of the previously discrete concepts of deliberate strategy, emergent strategy, and accountability. The study's ethnographic methods recorded and analyzed real-life interactions involving a board chair chief executive officer pair. The article presents a detailed narrative description of these actions to convey its key concept, blended strategizing, and to provide stimulus for new practice by leaders in governance situations."
454	2007	NVSQ	36:02:00	The Nature and Causes of the U-Shaped Charitable Giving Profile	"The U-shaped income-giving profile, where those in the lower and higher income brackets give higher percentages of their income to charity, has been the subject of much dispute. Examining data from 16,442 households, the authors find clear evidence of a U-shaped relationship. Previous findings contradicting the U-shaped profile are shown to suffer from selection bias that systematically deflates reported lower-income giving levels. Although the U-shaped profile is an appropriate descriptor, it does not reflect typical household behavior. Instead, it is driven almost entirely by the 5% of households that contribute one tenth or more of their after-tax income. Traditionally, the presence of so many highly committed, low-income households has been attributed to religious sect affiliation by the poor. The authors find an additional explanation in that these highly committed, lower-income households are dramatically wealthier than other members of their income classification, in part reflecting the presence of lower-income, higher-asset, retirement-aged households."
455	2007	NVSQ	36:02:00	Explaining Responses to Volunteering: An Ecological Model	"The author examined responses to volunteering as expressed in satisfaction with volunteering and burnout. The research sample consisted of 275 volunteers (212 women and 63 men) in various types of social service organizations in Israel. Based on Bronfenbrenner's ecological model, the author examined the contribution of variables from three ecological systems to explaining the outcome variables: (a) the ontogenic system (gender, age, education, and economic situation) and personality characteristics (self-esteem and empowerment), (b) the micro system (family context and volunteer context), and (c) the macro system, including variables reflecting cultural norms, as expressed in ethnic origin. Empowerment, self-esteem, and sociodemographic variables were the main variables related to satisfaction and burnout."
456	2007	NVSQ	36:02:00	An Investigation of Innovation in Nonprofit Organizations: The Role of Organizational Mission	"Nonprofit organizations are experiencing increasing pressures to be more business-like and to focus on financial outcomes for sustainability and growth. There have been questions whether this attention on performance might come at the cost of serving an organization's mission. The research presented here indicates that a nonprofit organization's mission can facilitate innovation, which has been shown to be a key mediating step in achieving superior organizational performance. Two studies were conducted among nonprofit hospitals in the United States to investigate the role of the nonprofit organization's mission in the innovation process. The findings indicate that a clear, motivating organizational mission helps an organization to focus its attention on those innovations that will most likely support the accomplishment of that mission. Such a mission also creates a climate in which innovations are given a fair chance to succeed. As a result, firms with clear, motivating missions tend to be more innovative."
457	2007	NVSQ	36:02:00	Public Policy Grant Making: Building Organizational Capacity Among Nonprofit Grantees	"Federal restrictions deter the involvement of private foundations in public policy making. In the 2000 grant year, public policy grant makers funded approximately 15,000 public policy grants worth more than $2.4 billion. These funds support the actions of nonprofit policy actors. Previous research suggests that funders that are committed to exerting influence in a policy system will invest in policy actor capacity development. This study seeks to identify the practice of funder investment in policy actor capacity. Three areas of capacity development are considered: research and communication capacity, resources acquisition capacity, and management and governance capacity. Consideration is also given to the concept of holistic investment. Are funders concerned with the overall capacity of the organization or just with specific dimensions of capacity? Records of grants made by 407 of the largest foundations in the United States serve as the data for the study."
458	2007	NVSQ	36:02:00	The Multiple Sources of Mission Drift	"This article examines Weisbrod's contention that nonprofits should avoid unrelated business activities, primarily because of their potential for mission drift. The conclusion reached is that commercial ventures are only one among several paths to mission drift, and not the most threatening. Furthermore, the bottom line retains its potential for mission drift, even in nonprofits that have no unrelated business activities. However, if mission drift has multiple sources, then the exclusion of one relatively minor source is not an adequate remedy."
459	2007	NVSQ	36:02:00	Representation in Nonprofit and Voluntary Organizations: A Conceptual Framework	"It is held that nonprofit and voluntary organizations contribute to democratic governance by representing the interests of their constituents to the state. Yet little is known about the capacities of these organizations to represent effectively their constituents and the larger community. This study proposes a framework for understanding the varieties of representation in nonprofit and voluntary organizations. The authors argue that the nature of representation within an organization is indicated by five dimensions: substantive, symbolic, formal, descriptive, and participatory representation. Formal, descriptive, and participatory representation are different means of achieving substantive and symbolic representation, the latter being measures of the extent to which organizations act for and stand for particular constituencies. They further suggest that this conceptual framework serves as a useful first step toward examining the representational capacities of nonprofit organizations. Two illustrative cases of community-based organizations are presented to tease out the complexity of representational mixes found in nonprofits."
460	2007	NVSQ	36:02:00	The Relationship Among Organizational-Based Self-Esteem and Various Factors Motivating Volunteers	"Organizational-based self-esteem (OBSE) reflects the perception individuals have of themselves as important, meaningful, effectual, and worthwhile within their organization. Employees with high OBSE participate in activities valued by their organization and in other organization-related behaviors that will benefit the organization to display organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of OBSE on the extent of voluntarism and the perceived motives behind why individuals volunteer. Using survey research, this study tested eight hypotheses and found six relating OBSE to the amount of time volunteered and the reasons for volunteering. The implications for organizations and employees are discussed."
461	2007	NVSQ	36:03:00	The Purpose (and Perils) of Government-Nonprofit Partnership	"This study seeks to understand similarities and differences in why local governments and nonprofits choose to collaborate, particularly when those relationships are not governed by formal contracts or grants. Exchange, transaction, and resource dependence theories are used to understand the perceived advantages and disadvantages of collaboration as expressed by local government and nonprofit executives. Based on two large, comparable samples from Georgia, the analysis finds that the two sectors demonstrate a remarkable similarity in the benefits they seek from public-private partnerships, but with some key differences. The motivation to partner is driven by a desire to secure those resources most scarce for the respective sector: expertise and capacity for government, funding for nonprofits. Nonprofit executives generally exhibit a stronger undercurrent of negativity toward intersectoral partnership than do their public sector counterparts. This article discusses possible reasons for these similarities and differences and contributes to the scholarship linking capacity with organizational outcomes."
462	2007	NVSQ	36:03:00	Acting in the Public Interest? Another Look at Research on Nonprofit Governance	"This article begins to fill gaps that currently exist between research on the governance of nonprofit organizations and research on public governance and focuses on how nonprofit governance research can benefit from insights in the public governance literature. As boundaries between nonprofit governance and public governance are increasingly fluid, our theoretical understanding as well as our empirical work on governance must expand to encompass these new relationships. The article summarizes the extant empirical literature on nonprofit governance and compares this research to emerging work on public governance. Drawing on this literature, the article specifically calls for research on nonprofit governance that (a) gives greater attention to the links between organizational governance and the public interest, (b) incorporates a broader view of governance as a process engaging multiple actors and taking place at multiple levels, and (c) links governance to accountability for results"
463	2007	NVSQ	36:03:00	Factors Explaining the Rating of Microfinance Institutions	"The growing relevance of Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) has led to the development of specialized MFI rating agencies that perform global risk assessments. In this article, the authors have conjectured different hypotheses pertaining to the relationship between financial and social indicators and the ratings assigned. The authors tested the hypotheses empirically by using MFIs accounting information and ratings from a leading agency. As expected, the larger, more profitable, more productive, and less risky MFIs achieved better ratings. This proves the usefulness of MFIs ratings for providers of funds. In contrast, the authors did not observe any relationship between social performance and rating. Given MFIs important social mission, agencies should develop ratings that accurately reflect the achievement of social goals."
464	2007	NVSQ	36:03:00	Superficial Friends: A Content Analysis of Nonprofit and Philanthropy Coverage in Nine Major Newspapers	"Hundreds of empirical studies indicate that the media can tell us not only what to think about but what to think. It is therefore likely that media coverage of nonprofits may have profound effects on the public's perception of the voluntary sector. Unfortunately, there is little empirical research about media coverage of nonprofits and almost none that is framed by communication theories. This article uses two such theories, agenda setting and media framing, to explore how nonprofits are portrayed in the media. A content analysis of 1,034 randomly sampled newspaper stories reveals that although nonprofit coverage is generally quite favorable, it is often episodic and not thematically framed. In addition, the results indicate that on the comparatively rare occasions when newspaper stories focus on the nonprofit sector as a whole instead of individual nonprofit organizations, the proportion of stories favorable toward nonprofits declines."
465	2007	NVSQ	36:03:00	The Effects of Children and Employment Status on the Volunteer Work of American Women	"Competing demands from work and family make it difficult for women to do volunteer work. An analysis of data from the Young Women's Cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey (1978-1991) shows that homemakers are more likely to volunteer than are full-time workers, followed by part-time workers. Mothers of school-age children are the most likely to volunteer, followed by childless women and mothers of young children. Mothers of school-age children are even more likely to volunteer if they are homemakers, and mothers of pre-school children are even less likely to volunteer if they work full-time."
466	2007	NVSQ	36:03:00	The Value of Volunteering for a Nonprofit Membership Association: The Case of ARNOVA	"Although research indicates that volunteer labor is of significant value to many nonprofit organizations, this value is generally not included in the organization's financial accounting statements. This study discusses the value added to nonprofit membership organizations of the volunteering done by its members. It uses an exploratory case study of the Association for Research on Nonprofits Organizations and Voluntary Action (ARNOVA) to demonstrate how volunteer labor is valued and presented within a social accounting framework by utilizing the Expanded Value Added Statement. This is followed by discussion of some of the benefits and limitations of such a method and policy implications."
467	2007	NVSQ	36:03:00	The Relativity of Foundation Effectiveness: The Case of Community Foundations	This article proposes that efforts to understand and achieve greater foundation effectiveness would be advanced by expanding the discussion to be more attuned to the relative and context-dependent nature of effectiveness. It illustrates this point through an analysis of community foundation effectiveness and comparisons of community foundations with private foundations. The findings show that effectiveness does not and cannot mean the same thing for community and private foundations because of their different contexts. The article further proposes that community foundations would strengthen their ability to address current challenges by developing a clearer and more realistic definition of effectiveness rooted in their distinctive mission and community context. The article is based on survey data from 236 community foundations and 853 private ones and interviews with chief executive officers and trustees of 21 community foundations.
468	2007	NVSQ	36:04:00	HRM Effectiveness in Older People's and Nursing Homes: The Search for Best (Quality) Practices	"This article presents an empirical evaluation of the human resources management (HRM) effectiveness in relation to quality of labor and quality of care in older people's and nursing homes. The authors suggest that innovative policies, in terms of HRM and work design, increase the likelihood of lower stress rates and higher scores on quality of care. The data supply little empirical evidence for this hypothesis, which means that innovative policy practices have very little effect on the realities of stress, burnout, and individually tailored care. A question that arises from this is whether the search for best practices is then equal to a measure for nothing. This is not the authors opinion. The reference framework for research must be turned round. This can be achieved by no longer starting from the normative (practice) theory but starting instead with excellent practice, which can teach researchers important content and policy lessons."

Clarifying the differences and connections between the two concepts through comparing emergency-services organizations in the two communities, the article identifies three kinds of organizations where civic engagement and social capital function differently: citywide civic-engagement organizations, community-based civic institutions, and social-capital organizations. Analysis of the three organization types reveals that social capital and civic engagement are not always intertwined and that civic engagement through contributing to a nonprofit organization can either involve most groups in a locality or represent civic activity of one group within the city for its own members or another specific group. Findings suggest that participation in social-service agencies through volunteering or donations does not necessarily lead to greater civic engagement."

As a partial answer to this question, the author describes the central patterns of growth, decline, and persistence of national self-help/mutual-aid organizations, their formal diversification, and the extent to which subpopulations gain market share. In addition to using an organizational ecological focus to map the trajectory of voluntary organizations, this article builds on resource partitioning theory by applying its central insights to subtypes of organizations. Expansion of self-help/mutual aid is remarkably similar to the trajectories of commercial and bureaucratic populations, but expectations that generalist concentration fosters growth of specialist organizations are not supported. Specialists dominate generalists except among medical self-help/ mutual aid. Implications for future research are discussed."

It is critical for social service professionals to gain the knowledge and skills to mobilize community members to join together and move from personal social concerns to collective concerns via organized community actions. However, the type of people who are likely to become involved in community mobilization efforts, and the motives for such participation, vary by country and culture. The purpose of this article is to present an urban community in Beijing and to identify factors that have affected community mobilization in urban China. Why might community mobilization factors in urban China be of interest to Western community practitioners and scholars? What is the appropriate theoretical framework within which to consider them? This article discusses these questions and raises questions for future research."

This is because the country lacks professional volunteer organizations, and limited research has evaluated Turkish volunteers. The main aims of the current study were to describe the personal characteristics of Turkey's community volunteers and to determine the influence of various motivational factors on their decision to serve in the Community Volunteer Foundation. The participants were a randomly selected sample of 175 community volunteers from different regions of Turkey. Findings showed that the average community volunteer was a 22-year-old, male college student pursuing a career in engineering, economics, or business. The most important motivational factors for volunteering were altruism, a filiation, and personal improvement (in that order). Completing an orientation course before working as a volunteer was considered useful. Recognition, by contrast, was not considered to be a vital factor."

"This article considers the nonprofit exemption from the corporate income tax (CIT), which has typically been justified with either subsidy or base-defining reasons. A different rationale is introduced: The corporate tax as applied to for-profit businesses is meant to capture in the tax base income ultimately owned by individuals that might otherwise escape tax, and the nonprofit exemption is a consequence of nonprofit income`s not being attributable to any individual. To explain why nonprofits are exempt from the CIT, scholars should begin by asking why there is a CIT at all rather than by asking what is so special about nonprofits. The argument is then applied to the debate over the rationale for the unrelated business income tax."
474	2007	NVSQ	36:04:00	An Investigation of Fraud in Nonprofit Organizations: Occurrences and Deterrents	"Losses due to fraudulent activities are particularly troublesome in the nonprofit sector because they directly reduce resources available to address tax-exempt purposes. The ensuing bad publicity also may reduce contributions and grants in subsequent periods. This article uses data provided by Certified Fraud Examiners to report on the types of fraud they identified in nonprofit organizations and the characteristics of both the victims and the perpetrators of the fraudulent activities. Based on the analysis of the data, the authors suggest ways that fraud losses can be prevented or mitigated. In particular, governing boards are urged to consider important controls in addition to the annual financial statement audit."

As a result, the third sector has emerged strongly, with nongovernmental organizations for development (NGODs) being a clear example of this. This type of organization is assumed to have a series of specific values, among which some of the most important are the fostering of social capital, financial autonomy, political independence, transparency, and good governance. This study analyzes the current position of this emerging sector in Spain. To achieve this, a series of index numbers have been established to measure these comparisons in order to study the types of relationships existing between them. The results show that the Spanish NGOD sector is developing toward transparency. However, from a financial point of view, it is still very dependent, not very critical, and very atomized."

Although some of these organizations date back to the 1940s, the majority of them were formed in the last three decades in a more open and accommodating society. For both of these immigrant groups, organizing to form and maintain religious organizations started early and continued to significantly affect the respective community. While Asian-American communities tend to focus on maintaining their heritage by forming numerous cultural organizations, the larger Hispanic-Latino population started early to form service agencies aided possibly by alternative means to maintain cultural identity. Immigrant religious organizations tend to be older and located in suburban middle-class communities with a diverse ethnic population. Immigrant secular organizations are generally younger, located in central city communities with a more homogeneous ethnic population. Older immigrant nonprofits also tend to be financially stronger and more stable."

Currently, 240 universities and colleges across the United States provide courses in nonprofit management education. This article reports on this growth through a compilation of the most recent data available from an electronic database accessible from the World Wide Web. The author maps the growth of the field during the past 10 years by type of program: graduate (including PhD), undergraduate, continuing education, and noncredit. Based on an analysis of developments and changes during the past 10 years, the author looks toward the future of nonprofit management education and philanthropy programs in the United States."

First, the nature and types of undergraduate programs in the United States are examined from a national database developed by Mirabella that answers these questions: How many colleges and universities offer undergraduate nonprofit studies? What colleges and departments offer these? Do they award degrees or certificates? What types of courses are offered? Where do their graduates get jobs? Then, four curricular models used by American Humanics (AH) campuses for nonprofit education are examined: certificate programs, academic minors, academic majors, and programs combining the previous three. The relationships of AH programs to higher education trends are identified and undergraduate nonprofit education programs beyond AH are examined."

Data regarding student interests and demand for courses was gathered using surveys of faculty members and PhD students. A systematic journal database search was conducted to better understand what disciplines engage in research on nonprofit organizations and voluntary action. Arguing that theory-based, doctoral-level education in the field of nonprofit and philanthropic studies is needed by academia and sought after by doctoral students, a framework for meeting the educational needs of the field's future scholars is proposed."

This disconnect manifests itself in critiques regarding the marginalization of practitioners and lack of knowledge sharing. The article examines the potential role of nonprofit doctoral student mentoring as a possible avenue for addressing the divide by developing the intellectual capacities of graduates to interact effectively in both the academic and practitioner domains. It stresses the importance of a particular form of mentoring and its ties to multiple, reinforcing opportunities for students if analytical, praxis-centered capacities are to be successfully developed. Ultimately, this article aims to stimulate discussion on the role and forms of mentoring of scholars who must develop praxis capacities rather than to offer definitive evidence of the superiority of one or another approach of ensuring that result."

A Case Study From the Netherlands	"This article focuses on the exposure of the typical undergraduate business student to the nonprofit sector and management, as opposed to focusing on learning opportunities available to interested students in particular, as is typically reviewed in research on nonprofit management education. To address this novel question, the authors employed a multimethod research strategy to investigate the coverage of the nonprofit sector in the undergraduate business degree program of a leading international business school: the Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University in the Netherlands. Based on an exhaustive review of course syllabi, interviews with faculty members, systematic analysis of course lecture notes, and a student discussion group, the results show rather tepid attention to the nonprofit sector and management in the undergraduate curriculum. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for instruction of business administration undergraduate students to prepare them for interaction with the nonprofit sector."

(yes, substantially), (b) is reported learning in nonprofit management course work related to satisfaction with career and with graduate program? (yes, to some degree), and (c) is alumni satisfaction with careers and graduate program more strongly related to extent of learning in some areas rather than others? (yes). Implications for curricular content of nonprofit management programs are considered, particularly the sort of enterprise nonprofit management education is (and the sort it should be). We conclude by suggesting that nonprofit management education distinctiveness is based on its moral imperative and urge some consideration of such in curricular design."

This article reports on the current configuration of international academic programs in nonprofit and philanthropic studies in Africa, Asia, the Pacific, Europe, and the Americas (apart from the United States), describing the various forms of education and training programs from country to country and continent to continent. The authors examine the similarities and differences in nonprofit management education programs in different parts of the world, seeking to explain why education programs have a range of forms indifferent parts of the world, according to different historical, institutional, and cultural contexts, thus furthering understanding of the asymmetries and complexities of existing NPO and NGO education and training programs."

The article examines the case for the institutionalization of nonprofit management education within the Irish societal context. Drawing on relevant literature and profiling the evolution of thinking on this subject within one education center, the article develops a case for state investment in institutionalization. The article concludes with a series of observations on the requirements for and implications of case development."

To explore this contention, the authors draw on several sets of evidence. First, they examine literature about these trends. Second, they draw on their research and consultancies in nonprofit management and in large-scale educational strategies. Third, they draw on their experiences of developing and teaching nonprofit management education programs in the United Kingdom. They argue that new problems have overlaid old problems in the nonprofit world. However, these are linked to broader societal trends that reflect new ways of organizing, and this shifts the focus of learning and development. Finally, they review the implications for nonprofit management education and set out some principles to guide new developments in this field."

That success creates the pressure for it to develop its standing as a discipline or as an interdisciplinary field that operates with the responsibilities of a discipline. This article outlines the process that Indiana UniversityPurdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) philanthropic studies faculty undertook to create a rationale for their work and suggests that the work offers a model for any faculty group facing deep and important changes in their contexts. Articulating the values and parameters of a field, as indicated by what the philanthropic studies faculty at IUPUI have done, needs to be pursued with increasing regularity as the conditions of faculty work continue to change and respond to new pressures on the academic community."
487	2008	NVSQ	37:01:00	The Transaction Cost Theory of the Nonprofit Firm: Beyond Opportunism	"Building on the transaction cost theory of the for-profit firm, the article argues that the transaction cost-economizing role of the nonprofit firm has two distinct dimensions. One of them consists of reducing the cost of searching for, processing, and communicating information and the other minimizes opportunistic behavior by means of aligning incentives of concerned stakeholders. So far, the transaction cost theory of the nonprofit firm has been emphasizing the second dimension while largely ignoring the first one. The article fills this gap by demonstrating that nonprofit firms are able to economize on transaction cost not only by minimizing opportunism but also by facilitating cooperation among those stakeholders who derive utility from contributing to the realization of their nonprofit firm's missions and hence would not be interested in opportunistic behavior. The article concludes by emphasizing the complementarity of the two dimensions of the nonprofit firm's transaction cost-economizing role."

The network actors are observed across three dimensions: collaboration, resource dependence, and information exchange, from the perspective of an intermediary organization. The following analysis, couched in the theory of efficient network structure, illustrates that governance structures within the CDFI industry involve an identifiable cohort of public, nonprofit, and private sector actors, and these associations facilitate a system of network links across an expansive array of resource needs."

Using the case of workplace charity, this article examines the determinants of nonprofit organizations adoption of donor choice as a mode of fund-raising. Drawing from a nationwide survey, it tests three competing tenets to explain United Ways implementation of donor choice. Employing logistic regression analysis, the findings indicate that United Ways allow for donor control when facing donors demands for choice, regardless of the composition of the local market or fundraisers organizational characteristics."

Using longitudinal data from the Americans Changing Lives surveys, this study assesses the effects of education and income on the type and scope of voluntary organization involvement. Multiple imputation and generalized estimating equations methods are used in the data analysis. The results indicate that more highly educated, older adults are more likely than their less-educated counterparts to volunteer in all five types of organizations (i.e., religious, educational, political, senior citizen, and others), volunteer in a wider range of organizations, and devote more hours. However, income makes little significant difference in organizational volunteering. Voluntary organizations are advised to facilitate older adults from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds in taking volunteer roles. Innovative recruitment programs are needed to tap the resource for volunteering that elders from all SES groups represent."

It reports on estimates and prevalence of such interchangeability through a series of studies of Canadian nonprofits: two national surveys of nonprofit organizations and case studies of two hospitals. The first study found evidence that volunteers were replacing paid staff and that paid staff were replacing volunteers, sometimes in the same organization. The second study explored this pattern further and found the percentage of tasks that were interchangeable. The third study found that about two-thirds of the organizations in the sample agreed that the interchangeability of tasks occurred, but the data indicated that it was limited to about 12% of tasks, not dissimilar to the estimates from the case studies. The implications of the results are discussed, and a model for the interchangeability of paid and volunteer labor is presented."

Although many studies focus on organization-level characteristics, the authors argue that nonprofit lobbying is driven by two different dynamics that operate at the field level: cross-sector competition and social change mission. Analyzing data on nonprofit organizations in California from 1998 to 2003, the authors show that nonprofits in mission-driven fields are more likely to lobby than nonprofits in other fields, but cross-sector competition does not seem to influence lobbying at the field level. The authors also find that many organization-level characteristics matter and nonprofits with lobbying experience tend to make the activity a regular component of their organizational repertoire. These findings have a variety of implications for work on civic engagement and the authors conclude with a discussion of the implications."

However, little is still known about why they die. This article attempts to fill this gap. It reconstructs the history of 41 closed Spanish voluntary associations of Madrid's metropolitan area through archival research and semistructured interviews to define the causes of their dissolutions. The conclusions indicate that the majority of the organizations dissolved due to mission completion (particularly goal fulfillment) and resource insufficiency. This article also uses central predictions of new institutionalism, population ecology, and resource dependence theories and shows that these three models provide valuable insights to account for these dissolutions. As each theory respectively predicts, those organizations with lower sociopolitical legitimacy, that were younger and smaller, or that were funded by only one source dissolved younger."

Evidence From a Spatial Analysis of Phoenix	"This work explores the spatial connections between nonprofit organizations that have an antipoverty focus and poor residents in the greater Phoenix, Arizona, metropolitan area. Substantial population and service growth occurred in Phoenix between 1990 and 2000, with almost twice the number of organizations and almost three times the amount of expenditures in 2000 than in 1990. Empirical evidence supports that these nonprofits locate in areas of greater need, but evidence that those organizations affect neighborhood poverty is weak, suggesting that the government should not retract services and that further nonprofit organizational growth may be necessary. The comprehensive measure of accessibility and two-way causal analysis are proposed for future replication."

This research note reports on discrepancies found between CEO and director perceptions of board involvement in the strategic management of credit unions. Consensus scores measure the dispersion of opinion, and the scores are compared to outcome measures using stepwise TOBIT analysis, which is rarely used in management research but is appropriate for studies with clustering of dependent variables. Findings reveal that the level of agreement about the board's involvement in mission statement development is associated with board member satisfaction. However, increases in the level of agreement about the board's involvement in monitoring strategy implementation are found in organizations that have less favorable financial soundness ratings."

Former Intel Chairman Andy Grove calls this a strategic inflection point. Philanthropy is on the brink of its own strategic inflection point. Just as the internet changed the face of commerce, so it can change fundamentally the way that social change can happen. Today, organizations can wholesale social change or develop programs that almost overnight touch millions of people. These `wholesaling' organizations share many common characteristics such as: (1) intent to impact the masses, (2) marginal, incremental cost to serve the next customer, (3) borderless service delivery, (4) grants plus business model, (5) redefining fundamental power relationships, (6) engage markets and market-driven solutions, (7) redirect ongoing flows of public or private sector funds to institutionalize desired change, and (8) use technology itself to provide innovative solutions. Philanthropy should define what `wholesaling activity' is, recognize it, and create mechanisms that will support acceleration of wholesale social change."

There has been a considerable amount of change in the field of disaster relief over the past 30 years. For example, access to victims has now become a right, the coordination between the different actors has become more organized, and principles have been created to guide relief response activities. Also, fund-raising continues to become increasingly more efficient. Still, there are many improvements that need to be made to prevent disasters and to best organize relief action when disaster does occur."

The dismal rates of morbidity and premature death among poor men and men of color in the United States underscore societal inequities and exacerbate health disparities among these populations. As the evidence of disparities continues to compound, the need for many-layered responses to address complex and intractable health inequalities becomes more obvious. Detailing the actual utilization of health services in specific populations by gender, race, ethnicity, and income can contribute to a wider understanding of health disparities and the costs of inadequate access to quality health care. Such population-based approaches to data collection and health service delivery within a community context can both ameliorate health disparities and suggest novel interventions to inform policy decisions. Nontraditional collaborations that create broad community coalitions around population-based approaches and join nonprofits with philanthropy, academe, and local, state, and federal governmental entities hold the greatest potential for lever-aging change."

Although downstream investment is attractive because of its immediate and measurable impact, this approach has a lower return on investment than do upstream strategies, which focus on root causes. This article explores investment in the development of a health care workforce with core professional responsibilities of health advocacy, public leadership, and interprofessional collaboration as one such upstream strategy. By supporting students who are engaged in communities, funders can build health professionals who are able to fulfill core roles of service and advocacy and become meaningfully engaged in re-envisioning American health care."

Yet one very obvious act of giving in the health field has been largely neglected in philanthropic studies: the donation of the body, such as blood and tissue donation, organ donation, and the donation of one's body for medical research or education. In August 2003, a research team at the Indiana University Center for Bioethics conducted a study of these two aspects of philanthropy as part of a project titled Health Related Philanthropy: The Donation of the Body (and Parts Thereof). This article describes the project and summarizes the results of a national survey conducted as part of that project."

It briefly traces the role of WHO in the history of major health achievements in recent decades, including the gradual elimination or control of major infectious diseases, often with philanthropic support from many countries and institutions. It also contributes to the current debate concerning the trends and directions of philanthropy in health in the first decade of the 21st century."
502	2008	NVSQ	37:02:00	Account Space: How Accountability Requirements Shape Nonprofit Practice	"Improving nonprofit accountability is one of the most important issues facing the sector. Improving nonprofit accountability in ways that are attentive to what we might consider unique and valuable about how nonprofits address public problems is the challenge at hand. This article presents a framework for examining the consequences of accountability systems for nonprofit practice. Drawing on empirical findings from three case studies and early sociological work on accounts, the framework considers four questions (i.e., When do organizations give accounts? What is the purpose of the account? When are those accounts accepted or rejected by important stakeholders? And with what consequence?) but makes a distinction between a verification and explanatory accountability process. By making this distinction and clarifying the relationship between these two accountability processes, the proposed framework can be used to identify conflicts between accountability systems and nonprofit practice and to understand how efforts to ensure accountability can spur a change in nonprofit practice, change stakeholder expectations for nonprofits or leave both intact."

Nonprofits at the start-up or growth phase face a particular set of challenges in maintaining their adaptive capacity. A theoretical framework for assessing a nonprofit's organizational readiness to improve its adaptive capacity was developed and applied to 10 emerging social change nonprofits in Israel. The results demonstrate the utility of the conceptual framework while providing insight into the day-to-day realities of organizational life that help to shape the adaptive capacity of the 10 nonprofits in the sample. Key issues relating to the adaptive capacity of the nonprofits and their particular stage of organizational development also are raised."

The intensity and scope of 13 European voluntary sectors are analyzed on both the individual and aggregate levels. This reveals no additional effect of face-to-face contact (active participation) over passive membership. Thus, the primary mechanism of social capital formation in the voluntary sector cannot be socialization of individual members. Furthermore, effects at the aggregate level are much stronger than at the individual level. This indicates that social capital is constructed through institutional (macro), not social (micro) processes. It is not face-to-face encounters but awareness of strong and visible voluntary organizations in society that generate a belief in the utility and rationality of collective action. Thus, voluntary organizations institutionalize rather than generate social capital."

A possible explanation for the substantial variability in giving lies in the measurement of income. In addition to permanent and transitory income, this article introduces the variability of income as a factor affecting charitable donations. The variability of income increases with the level of household income and varies by the source of income. In distinguishing types of income the authors are also able to shed some light on decision making by married couples. The effect of changes in permanent household income on charitable giving is significantly larger than that of transitory household income. Greater variability in the flow of annual household income has a negative effect on total giving. In addition, the authors find some significant differences in the impact on giving between the husband's and wife's earnings."
506	2008	NVSQ	37:02:00	Asymmetric Mutuality: User Involvement as a GovernmentVoluntary Sector Relationship in Norway	"User involvement (UI) has been introduced as a measure to ensure more focused, efficient, client-oriented, service-minded health and welfare services. User involvement as participation in planning and decision making requires collective action on behalf of more or less formally organized groups of people for whom welfare policy is targeted, for instance people with long-term somatic or mental health problems or impairments. User involvement is thus to be understood as a specific kind of government-voluntary relationship. By utilizing a combination of social movement perspectives and neoinstitutional perspectives, the article explores the conditions behind the growth of UI and the characteristics of the relationship of UI compared with other government-voluntary relationships in the field of health and welfare philanthropy and corporatist relations."

An Examination of Motives for Arts Performance Attendance	"Given finite amounts of time for leisure activities and a consuming public that continues to feel time pressured, what drives attendance at arts performances? This study builds on existing arts research and its use of demographic characteristics by considering the psychological motives of theater patrons. Six potential motives of performing arts attendees are identified, and their relationship with demographic characteristics and behavioral outcomes are assessed. Data were obtained from a midwestern U.S. performing arts center, the sample was drawn from spectators at three different performances. Analysis of variance and t-test results indicate significant relationships between certain motivations and patronage variables such as years of attendance, number of performances attended, and time frame for planning to attend future events. Similarly, significant differences in motivation were found by gender, age, income, and education level, suggesting that attendance could be enhanced by tailoring motive specific messages to each of these groups."

Today the field has been refined, and its proponents are more modest. The case of venture philanthropy provides insights into the construction and evolution of a new organizational field and new professional culture, topics that require further scholarly exploration. Qualitative research examining venture philanthropy organizations and their leaders is reported here. Findings suggest that although the dot-com boom was an important prompt, the construction and diffusion of the field depended on opinion leaders who strategically defined, legitimated, and advocated the new model. The fit with existing culture and institutionalization via networks were also important. Implementation difficulties and the business nonprofit culture clash are among factors forcing evolution of the field. Several avenues for further research on this understudied field, and on other new fields and hybrid professional cultures, are suggested by these findings."

As American women's philanthropic opportunities have traditionally been limited to participation in fund-raising events, this model has demonstrated that there is a stimulating and effective alternative. Members join together, pooling brain power and yearly dues, in order to select a single annual grant in their community that will fund an innovative, replicable project for children. By leveraging their dollars, they are able to have a much more significant impact in the community than they could individually. With its democratic voting system, lack of hierarchy, and flexibility, the model is inclusive and fits within the lifestyle of busy contemporary women. Its formula has enabled its members to feel a sense of ownership in the organization and inspired many to venture further into the philanthropic world on their own. Its system of accountability has provided its members with the confidence that their dollars are well spent."

The authors argue that researchers must expand this conceptualization of volunteering to include the interactive process between the volunteer and the organization. Using structuration theory as a guiding framework, the authors examine how volunteers behavior is both shaped by and also affects the way in which two organizations are structured. In this comparative case study, the authors utilize participant observation, interviews, and archival analysis to illustrate this interaction in two organizations, a no-kill cat shelter and a resource organization for women who partner with women. They find that the character of the labor process, and specifically whether it entails the expenditure of emotional labor, leads to either burdensome or rewarding volunteer experiences. The authors further underscore the importance of examining emerging trends in episodic volunteering and shifts in nonprofit organizations toward more bureaucratized business forms."

And how can these gains be mobilized for poverty alleviation, justice, and development, especially in at-risk countries? Following reviews of potential diaspora contributions and the parameters of at-risk societies, the case of Coptic Orphans is presented. Coptic Orphans provides a model for channeling remittances to meet the subsistence and development needs of the poorest of the poor and sustaining these contributions beyond the first generation. It illustrates how diaspora organizations can effectively navigate the social and legal challenges of operating in an at-risk society. Finally, it suggests that diaspora organizations may increasingly overcome voluntary failures to become a significant sector in the international development arena."
512	2008	NVSQ	37:03:00	Government Funding and Nonprofit Organizations	"In this article, the author tests whether there is a simultaneous relationship between the number of nonprofits and government funding of nonprofit activity and whether the fundraising efforts of nonprofits are the means by which nonprofits affect the grants available to them. Estimates of the model are consistent with the proposition that government grants and contracts (program revenues) received by nonprofits are strong determinants of the number of nonprofits in a state. They lend support to the argument that nonprofit fundraising activities have an independent effect on the availability of the grants and contracts, however, although the number of nonprofit organizations per state has a similar effect on grants to nonprofits, they do not have an effect on the contacts they receive."

One such line of work has documented advantages from employers adopting generous compensation practices, as evidenced by more successful worker recruitment and retention. Little of this work, however, has attended to benefits provided within nonprofit and public human service settings or to low-level workers. Drawing on a sample of Wisconsin nursing homes, this study addresses this gap by examining the roles of ownership, chain affiliation, and professional leadership in compensation provided to nursing assistants. Results indicate that public and nonprofit ownership and chain membership are positively related to benefit levels. Workers fare unexpectedly less well with professional directors in for-profit and public settings but better within professionally led nonprofits."
514	2008	NVSQ	37:03:00	Charity Brand Personality: The Relationship With Giving Behavior	"Charity brands have been found to assist income generation by enhancing donor understanding of an organization and what it stands for. Despite an increasing interest in this topic, few studies have addressed the dimensions of such brands and sought to explore the link (if any) with donor behavior. The authors report the results of a large-scale postal survey of donors to nine national nonprofits and conclude that traits associated with benevolence, progression, and conservatism are incapable of distinguishing between the study's participating brands. Traits associated with emotional engagement, service, voice, and tradition are capable of serving as the basis for differentiation and are also linked to facets of individual giving behavior."

Analyses indicate that NGOs are more connected to government authorities than to any type of nonstate organization. Results also suggest that NGOs located in municipalities where support was the highest and lowest in the 1994 to 2001 elections for the long-ruling Partido Revolucionario Institucional were best connected to the government. The size of Indigenous populations located around the NGOs also appears to have had an impact on NGO connectedness to the government. These results offer support for social origins theory, which acknowledges the impact of socialpolitical environments on the development of NGO sectors."

To assess this role, the authors constructed a new data set that covers more than 1,600 secular and religious PVOs that registered with the U.S. federal government between 1939 and 2004. In the postWorld War II period, major revenue patterns are the rise of Evangelical PVOs, decline of Jewish PVOs, and rapid growth of secular PVOs from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s. The authors analyze the determinants of changes in PVO size, gauged by real revenue. They focus on the interplay between public revenue (from the federal government, international organizations, and other governments) and private revenue. Specifically, they investigate whether funds from the federal government and other public entities serve as a magnet for subsequent private support."
517	2008	NVSQ	37:03:00	Using Lessons From Public Affairs to Inform Strategic Philanthropy	"Although private, institutional philanthropy can be an engine of significant social change, often this possibility is not realized. This article creates a new framework to inform philanthropic strategy built from lessons gleaned from decades of public affairs research. Drawing on what is known about social change movements, government relationships with nonprofits, and nonprofit management, key questions help foundation staff develop and hone their strategy. A flexible framework for private investment in human services fields is developed and implications for practice and future research are considered."
518	2008	NVSQ	37:04:00	Advocacy Activities in Nonprofit Human Service Organizations: Implications for Policy	"The article describes political and advocacy activity in nonprofit human service organizations for children, elderly people, women, and people with disabilities. On the whole, the level of their political activity was found to be moderate, as perceived by the directors of the organizations. The main findings reveal a significant positive correlation between advocacy and political activity in nonprofit organizations and their perceived influence on setting the public agenda. Analysis of the findings indicates that the larger the number of volunteers in the organization, the greater the organization's political influence. In addition, it was found that the more dependent the organizations were on funding from local authorities, the lower the level of advocacy and political activity. The effectiveness of strategies used to attain political influence was also analyzed. The most effective strategy was exerting pressure on decision makers, both on the national and local levels."
519	2008	NVSQ	37:04:00	Foundation Impact on Environmental Nongovernmental Organizations: The Grantees Perspective	"A survey of U.S. environmental nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) receiving grants in 2000 from private California foundations allowed the authors to evaluate conflicting claims on the impact of foundation funding on nonprofit grantees. Different from the view of elitist critics that foundations co-opt their grant recipients, these NGO respondents view foundations as mildly constructive across several organizational domains. These results are more consistent with pluralist and resource dependency arguments that view foundation donors as supportive of NGO capacity building. Whether the funding impact is cooptation or capacity building has less to do with NGOs degree of dependency on philanthropic funds and more with grant types received and their organizational traits. Multiyear programmatic grants are associated with capacity-building, whereas 1-year program grants are associated with cooptation. A simplistic interpretation of elitist theory may underestimate the diversity of motivations among funders and the tremendous administrative costs associated with a rigid supervision of grantees."

The framework used to analyze the relationship between religion and civil society borrows from Arendt's, Habermass, and Rawlss writings in political philosophy. In its core analytical claim, the article draws a division between a discourse-based deliberative democracy and one that is based on participation in mostly local communities and associations. In this context, the author contrasts a social-capital approach to understanding the role of religion and civil society with one that emphasizes the primacy of political relations and hence the importance of political capital. The purpose of the article is to provide a critical framework that can be used by theoreticians and practitioners, facing issues of management and political activism in an organizational environment, in which religious values and secular guidelines increasingly overlap."

Buying Groups and Small Firm Community Involvement"	"Does buying group membership affect small firm community involvement, and if it does, is there a further effect, in particular as it concerns small firm performance? This article addresses this intersection of issues. After advancing a set of hypotheses linking categorical and continuous dimensions of buying group activity to community involvement, this article also tests hypotheses of enlightened self-interest concerning the relationship between community involvement and firm performance. The article then describes a study of more than 300 small retail hardware stores. The findings show buying group membership being positively related to both scale and scope of community involvement. The authors also report a complex set of findings concerning the interaction of community involvement and buying group membership with small firm performance. The article concludes by reflecting on what these findings suggest for further work in small firm philanthropy."

Sector Shifting and Choice of Sector by MPA and MBA Graduates	"Despite debate about distinctions among employment in the government, nonprofit, and business sectors, little research exists on the likelihood of, or barriers to, movement across sector boundaries. The authors propose and test models explaining individuals current sector of employment business, government, or nonprofit and their sector-shifting behavior. They use survey data from 688 alumni of four schools: two offering MBAs and two offering MPAs. Study results indicate that most respondents have a favored sector when they graduate and remain within that sector for their employment. Results also indicate that this sector preference is influenced by perceived competence in the sectors and individuals career values. This study shows that sector shifting is tied to sector desires and the strength of protean career orientation. The results are used to address existing claims about careers and to build understanding of influences on perceived sector competence and desires. The discussion informs employers and educators."
523	2008	NVSQ	37:04:00	Do Occupational Group Members Vary in Volunteering Activity?	"The goal of our study is to explore how employees in different occupations report volunteering activities. Starting from the literatures on occupational subcultures and professional norms, the authors hypothesize that both structural constraints and norms of occupations may have an impact on extraorganizational behavior. Analyzing Center on Philanthropy Panel Study data linked with the Institute for Social Research's Panel Study on Income Dynamics, the authors find evidence that individuals in professional, managerial, and military occupations are more likely to volunteer than are individuals in other occupational categories. Controlling for individual demographic and cultural variables, they affirm the explanatory power of occupation on individual volunteering behavior."

Following a brief description of qualification principles for NPAs, treatment of business units, or liability issues, a particular focus is put on a comparison of regulations concerning the taxation of current profits, inheritance, and gift taxes and the tax treatment of contributions and membership fees. In general, a strong similarity among the examined developed countries can be found for the different aspects considered, but significant differences also exist."

Bush's presidency. Although the knowledge base on FBO activity has expanded in recent years, a number of factors make it difficult to ascertain the actual value of the services provided by these groups. This Research Note is concerned with reviewing several important studies in the emerging research to establish a comprehensive estimate for the dollar value of the social services provided by FBOs. The analysis in this research note reveals the value of the FBO contribution to be greater than previously recognized."
526	2008	NVSQ	37:04:00	Tainted Money and Charity: Do 501(c)(3)s Have a Right to Refuse a Gift?	"This article examines the right of a 501(c)(3) organization to refuse an unrestricted cash donation, concluding that such right is generally illusory. If a charity disagrees with the donor on a moral issue, it may see nothing improper in turning away a would-be benefactor. When this occurs in the context of a 501(c)(3) organization, its exempt purpose requires looking beyond the conscience of the individuals making the decision. Specifically, the question of the organization's moral right to turn away funding occurs in the context of its pursuit of a legally sanctioned purpose. The organization's agreement with the IRS in seeking tax-exempt status produces a fiduciary responsibility with its stakeholders. These include donors, potential recipients of the organization's goods or services, taxpayers, and the government. Viewed from this perspective, turning down a gift, it is argued, is comparable to mismanagement in squandering scarce resources."
527	2009	NVSQ	38:01:00	The Matching of Motivations to Affordances in the Volunteer Environment: An Index for Assessing the Impact of Multiple Matches on Volunteer Outcomes	"The functional approach to volunteerism holds that outcomes from volunteering (e.g., satisfaction and intentions to remain a volunteer) are a function of the match between a volunteer's motivations and affordances to meet those motivations found in the environment (i.e., the volunteer activities, position, or organization). In this article, the authors introduce an index for calculating a volunteer's total number of matches across six motivational categories identified by past research. They demonstrate that this index predicts outcomes better than motives or affordances alone and as well as any univariate match index (i.e., in a particular motivational category). Following logic about strong and weak situational contexts, the authors demonstrate that the magnitude of the total matches effect may be greater when organizational contexts are less structured and smaller when contexts are more structured. They discuss theoretical and practical benefits of this total match index."
528	2009	NVSQ	38:01:00	Identifying the Factors That Influence Positioning Strategy in U.K. Charitable Organizations That Provide Public Services: Toward an Integrating Model	"This article is based on empirical research that for the first time identifies and explains the key factors that influence the organizational-level positioning strategy of charities involved in the delivery of public services within the wider voluntary nonprofit sector in the United Kingdom. The multidimensional factors are integrated in a theoretical model, which the authors argue is better able to accommodate the charitable context. The model suggests that a combination of external environmental, organizational, and mediating factors influence the positioning strategy of charities. Several of these factors are unique to the charitable context. They highlight the inadequacy of the existing marketing and strategy literature on positioning to fully explain strategic positioning in charities. Together, the research findings and the model provide distinct additions to the voluntary sector management literature while also providing an alternative perspective to researching charity positioning in contemporary marketing and strategy literature."

Such cooperation is expected to threaten inventiveness of the NGO sector, including its spontaneity, variety, and unpredictability. This article analyzes the internal institutional processes of three leading housing NGOs as they each implemented cooperative strategies with the state in Mumbai, India. It finds that, contrary to customary apprehensions, NGOs use different tactics in response to the same public policy environment. The article argues that pervasive isomorphism is constrained by path dependency and variability in resource environments."
530	2009	NVSQ	38:01:00	"Charitable Giving, Volunteering, and the Paid Labor Market"	"Among the few articles that jointly determine an individual's gifts of time and money, there exists disagreement as to whether these gifts are complements or substitutes. The authors try to shed some light on this debate by expanding the analysis of private contributions to take account of whether or not the individual is working in the paid labor market. The analysis indicates that gifts of time and money are largely complementary to each other, especially for employed individuals. The donations of employed males also appear to be crowded out by government expenditures. The fact that employment status as well as gender affect how individuals respond to fiscal stimulus may have important policy implications."

Perhaps the most commercial of all activities undertaken by nonprofits are those considered to be so far removed from an organization's exempt mission that the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) considers them to be taxable. Examination of these taxable activities can provide unique and valuable insights into the effects of purely commercial activities on nonprofit behavior. Nonprofits report their taxable activities on the confidential IRS 990-T. Although some information on taxable activities is reported on the publicly available IRS 990, unavailability of the IRS 990-T has prevented prior examination of its accuracy and reliability. Using a unique data set of otherwise confidential IRS 990-Ts, the authors calibrate the reliability of taxable activities as reported on the IRS 990, providing a roadmap for researchers to follow when examining nonprofits taxable activities using publicly available data."
532	2009	NVSQ	38:01:00	Challenges in Multiple Cross-Sector Partnerships	"This research examines challenges associated with partnerships among a group of cross-sector organizations. The context for this study is a nonprofit organization in Canada's sport system and its numerous partners in public, nonprofit, and commercial sectors. The results reveal challenges in the areas of structure and strategy. Specifically, data uncover structural challenges with respect to problems with governance, roles, and responsibilities guiding the partnerships and with the complexity of partnership forms and structures. The data also uncover strategic challenges, in light of the focus on competition versus collaboration among various partners and the changes in missions and objectives through the duration of the relationship. The results and implications for nonprofit organizations involved in multiple cross-sector partnerships are discussed."
533	2009	NVSQ	38:01:00	Volunteering and Its Relationship With Personal and Neighborhood Well-Being	"Although a relationship between volunteering and well-being has been demonstrated in numerous studies, well-being has generally been poorly operationalized and often defined by the relative absence of pathology. In this study, the authors take a positive approach to defining well-being and investigate the relationship between volunteering and personal and neighborhood well-being. The theoretical approach incorporates elements of the homeostatic model of well-being. A sample of 1,289 adults across Australia completed a questionnaire that assessed personal and neighborhood wellbeing, personality factors, and the psychosocial resources implicated in the homeostatic model of well-being. Analyses reveal that volunteers had higher personal and neighborhood well-being than nonvolunteers and that volunteering contributed additional variance in well-being even after psychosocial and personality factors were accounted for. The findings are discussed in terms of previous research and the homeostatic model of well-being, and it is argued that the relationship between volunteering and well-being is robust."

Comparing the Baby Boom, Silent, and Long Civic Cohorts"	"Data from the 1995 and 2005 waves of the Midlife in the United States panel study were used to compare rates of volunteering among the baby boomers with earlier cohorts and to predict boomers future volunteering. When age was kept constant through the use of panel data, the first baby boom cohort (born 1946 to 1955) did more volunteering than did the silent cohort (born 1936 to 1945), and the silents volunteered more than did the long civic cohort (born 1926 to 1935). The author generated regression equations that used nine 1995 variables to predict 2005 volunteering and used the boomers 2005 values on these variables to predict their 2015 volunteering. These equations slightly predict higher volunteering among the boomers in 2015 than the silents did in 2005. This result, combined with the large size of the boomer cohort, indicates that the total number of elderly volunteers will probably increase in the next decade."

This study offers a conceptualization and preliminary measurement strategy to enhance knowledge on the institutional capacity of volunteer programs to engage older adults. Data were collected from 51 program directors to assess 10 dimensions of institutional capacity: specification of role, dissemination of information, role availability, compensation of expenses, in-kind incentive, skill development, role flexibility, role recognition, accommodation, and integration. Eight factors were identified. The subscales were moderately reliable, and dimensions were independent. Programs rated highest on the capacity to recognize volunteers and disseminate information and lowest on their ability to provide cash compensation. Subsequent research on institutional capacity depends on its strong measurement. Future works will assess the extent to which these institutional capacity factors affect the recruitment, retention, and effective utilization of older volunteers."
536	2009	NVSQ	38:02:00	The Effects of Nonprofit Accountability Ratings on Donor Behavior	"Although accountability systems are established to ensure organizational adherence to financial and ethical standards for nonprofit organizations, the reality of whether such standards make a difference to donors has not been measured. This article discusses the current landscape of accountability systems and accountability ratings and describes a model for estimating the effect of ratings systems on donor behavior within the theoretical context of information asymmetry. Hypotheses are tested with nonprofit ratings for New York charities from the Better Business Bureau's Wise Giving Alliance to estimate the effect of accountability ratings on the amount of contributions an organization receives. Results indicate that the Wise Giving Alliance pass ratings have a statistically significant effect on the contributions received, however, did not pass ratings are nonsignificant. The study is important for academics as well as practitioners who are monitoring time and money spent on accountability issues."
537	2009	NVSQ	38:02:00	Public Confidence in Charitable Nonprofits	There has been much talk in recent years of a crisis of confidence in charities in the United States. This article presents a conceptual framework for analyzing the issue and reviews attitudinal and behavioral data relevant to public confidence in the nonprofit sector generally and major nonprofit subsectors. The article concludes that the crisis of confidence hypothesis is not supported by the evidence.
538	2009	NVSQ	38:02:00	Relationships Between Leadership Styles and Followers Emotional Experience and Effectiveness in the Voluntary Sector	"Research on transformational and transactional leadership has been dominated by research conducted in for-profit organizations. The objective of this study is to provide information about the role of emotions within transformational and transactional leadership in the voluntary sector. In addition, the effectiveness of leadership styles is explored. By examining the singers (N= 288) perception of German choir conductors leadership behaviors, the present study shows that positive emotions are more closely associated with transformational leadership than with transactional leadership. Furthermore, negative emotions are more strongly related to transactional than to transformational leadership. Besides, choir conductors transformational leadership augments the impact of transactional leadership on singers satisfaction, their extra effort and effectiveness. In combination, the results allow for a more thorough and detailed understanding of effective leadership behavior in voluntary organizations."

Almost a quarter of public development aid is channeled through a selective group of NGDOs that have to satisfy a broad range of institutional and operational criteria. The procedures for defining the eligibility of these co-financing organizations have recently been streamlined to enhance competition and to guarantee more objective fund allocation. This article provides a critical review of the current system for allocating public funding to private development organizations and discusses the criteria used for comparing institutional performance and assessing the quality of submitted multiyear co-funding requests. Even though important progress has been made in cross-organizational appraisal of development agencies, the operationalization of selected indicators still suffers from ambiguities and arbitrary weighing procedures. Past performance and demand-side criteria are not yet considered, thus reducing the potential relevance of the assessment system for improving the effectiveness of development projects."
540	2009	NVSQ	38:02:00	Do Poverty Attitudes of Social Service Agency Directors Influence Organizational Behavior?	"This article explores why people are poor and on welfare, according to social service agency directors who administer programs that serve current and former welfare recipients. Based on data from 295 local social service agency directors in Indiana, 75% of respondents believe educational and labor market barriers are important causes of long-term poverty and welfare, 44% believe cultural transmission or learned lifestyles are causes, 23% believe poor attitudes and work ethics as well as laziness or lack of motivation among the poor are causes, and 8% believe government assistance causes dependency among recipients and makes them poor. Evidence suggests that agency directors who believe that poor attitudes and behavior of the poor primarily cause poverty and welfare are more likely to be in organizations that did not ration services since welfare reform or engage in political activities designed to support these changes. In contrast, agency directors who maintain educational and labor market barriers as primary causes of poverty and welfare are more likely to be in organizations that have adopted new programs and developed collaborative strategies with other organizations since welfare reform."

The initiative is described, and the results of a recent benchmarking survey of the Top 500 Fundraising Charities that will be used to underpin it are reported. The mean cost of raising £1 was found to be £0.21."
542	2009	NVSQ	38:03:00	Delegation of Coordination and Outcomes in Cross-Sector Partnerships: The Case of Service Learning Partnerships	This article furthers knowledge on cross-sector partnerships. It distinguishes between partnerships that produce predefined outcomes and those that produce co-defined ones. Predefined outcomes are defined by one partner prior to the formation of the partnership and could have been attained easily with alternative partners. Co-defined outcomes are defined by partners in mutual consultation and tailored to the resources and goals of the participants. The article identifies delegation as a factor that crucially defines whether partnerships produce pre- or co-defined outcomes. Delegation occurs when there is a clear-cut division between coordination and participation so that staff members engaged as coordinators are otherwise disengaged from the partnership. Delegated partnerships those with coordinators engaged only in coordinating duties are likely to produce predefined outcomes whereas undelegated partnerships are likely to produce co-defined outcomes. The article builds on a grounded theory study of 11 service learning partnerships formed by institutions of higher education and community organizations.
543	2009	NVSQ	38:03:00	Community Foundation Development and Social Capital	"The recent worldwide growth of community foundations presents new opportunities for community-based social change. Realizing that promise requires that community foundations sustain the charitable support of their communities with increasing competition for these resources, and thus an understanding of the connection between community characteristics and charitable giving is necessary. The authors focus here on the potential role of community social capital. This study develops and empirically explores a model that connects social capital and gifts to community foundations, while controlling for community demographics and the community's exposure to charitable organizations. The authors find that per capita gifts to community foundations increase with the level of social trust in the community. In addition, gifts are affected by the number of years that community foundations have existed in the region, population density, homeownership, and the poverty rate. Implications are developed for community foundations and for our understanding of the different dimensions of social capital."
544	2009	NVSQ	38:03:00	Sociodemographic and Personality Characteristics of Canadian Donors Contributing to International Charity	"This study aims to establish a sociodemographic and personality profile of Canadians who donate internationally, fills the gap in the literature with regard to individual-level determinants of international giving, and compares these determinants with those of domestic donors. Women, volunteers, and individuals of non-Canadian origin, with higher income, higher education, higher level of religiosity, higher political awareness and participation, and higher frequency of extended family participation were more likely to contribute internationally. Higher education and a higher level of religiosity seem to influence international giving more than they did domestic giving. In terms of the variations in amount of international donations the important determinants are income, education, level of religiosity, and feeling of financial security. These results suggest that international charities should probably target their efforts at more-educated, higher-income and more-religious individuals. The other target donors are volunteers, women, individuals of non-Canadian origin, and politically aware and socially involved individuals."

The authors focused on gaining insight into the organizational differences among companies that are have integrated corporate philanthropy into their cultures, those where philanthropy is marginal to their main business and those that see philanthropy as a beneficial relationship. They learned that companies that have integrated philanthropy into their operations are quite distinct in both attitudes and behavior from the others. Although companies can change the role of philanthropy within their organization, truly integrating philanthropy into the business of the corporation is not something that can develop and evolve over time, if that vision is not present in the corporate culture from the beginning, it is not likely to develop."
546	2009	NVSQ	38:03:00	How Tough are Better Business Bureau/Wise Giving Alliance Financial Standards?	"The use of financial efficiency ratios to judge charities performance is controversial. The authors investigate the stringency of one widely used set of standards by examining reported 2001 data for more than 111,000 organizations. The authors suggest the ability of many organizations to comply inhibits protests against the widespread use of these ratios. The Wise Giving Alliance adopted stricter standards in 2003, and the authors find that more organizations will be able to meet the new standards. As in the past, the great majority of organizations report compliance. The authors note marked differences in the rates of compliance with both the program spending and fund-raising efficiency standards by sector. Also, organizations with larger special events tend to incur relatively larger costs. The authors question the use of the same ratios for all organizations. The authors note no evidence of widespread expense allocation manipulation around the critical levels of ratios monitored by the Alliance."

"To date, the common rhetoric and assumptions on the performance of faith-based organizations (FBOs), ironically, appear to be faith based rather than empirically supported: There is a paucity of research evaluating the effectiveness of FBOs that uses sufficiently rigorous methods and multiple measures of organizational performance. This study seeks to inform the debate on the relative effectiveness of FBOs by comparing religiously affiliated and secular nonprofit nursing homes using two distinct but complementary measures of organizational performance: service quality and access for impoverished clients. Using nationally representative panel data on 11,877 church-affiliated and secular nonprofit nursing homes, this study examines the effect of ownership with several regression models. Overall, the findings fail to confirm the assumption that FBOs perform better than secular nonprofit organizations in the context of the nursing home industry. Isomorphic pressures and commercialization trends within the nursing home industry are discussed to help explain these findings."

This population expects improvement in its situation but develops a dependent relationship with the help agents. The literature shows that volunteer work contributes toward developing empowerment among volunteers, but to date only a relatively small number of welfare clients have been activated as volunteers, serving more as the object of others volunteer work. This article describes a classic experimental study, checking the connection between welfare clients volunteering and their individual feeling of empowerment. The main and most significant finding in the study demonstrated that individual feeling of empowerment among clients who engaged in volunteer work was higher than that of clients not engaged in such work. The findings suggest that volunteer work may serve as an effective intervention tool in social work, whose aim is change in welfare clients feelings of empowerment."
549	2009	NVSQ	38:03:00	It Ain't Natural: Toward a New (Natural) Resource Conceptualization for Volunteer Management	"This article presents a new conceptualization of volunteerism as a natural resource. The authors propose that volunteer energy can be understood as a human-made, renewable resource that can be grown and recycled, and whose continuation and volume of flow can be influenced by human beings positively as well as negatively. Based on this conceptualization, we describe the major features of volunteer energy and suggest that a new regenerative approach is necessary for the field to fully embrace it. We develop the new approach and contrast it with the traditional instrumental approach to volunteer management."

It describes reasons for the increasing marketization of nonprofit and voluntary organizations and what the literature has shown to be problematic about marketization. It argues that one way to resist colonization by the market is for academics and practitioners of voluntary and nonprofit organizations to create and apply a democratic counter-discourse.
551	2009	NVSQ	38:04:00	Community Carrying Capacity: A Network Perspective	"Scholars have explored the idea of the determinants of the size of the nonprofit sector as a linear relationship between supply of resources and the demand for nonprofit services. This in turn has fueled debate about whether there are too many nonprofits for available resources. In this article, we propose that the scarcity (or abundance) of resources does not inherently determine the limits of a community's nonprofit carrying capacity. Rather, network exchanges between nonprofits and other organizations may exhibit positive synergistic effects that are associated with diverse outcomes. We therefore propose a model of nonprofit carrying capacity that shifts the discussion to the ability of a community to support network exchanges among independent agents."

553	2009	NVSQ	38:04:00	A Fifth Nonprofit Regime?: Revisiting Social Origins Theory Using Jewish Associational Life as a New State Mode	"In their social origins theory, Salamon and Anheier demonstrated the need to consider the historical past of societies in order to trace additional factors that motivate and shape the scope and nature of the third sector. This article elaborates the social origins approach to adjust it to a wider spectrum of states and nations and to additional historical experiences. It sheds light on societies that achieved independence after 1945 and went through a process of decolonization. In these countries, social structures and relations with governing authorities were different from the European and North American patterns that inspired the social origins approach. Taken together, such societies suggest an additional theoretical framework one that explains the structure and characteristics of the third sector in new states in the light of their distinctive historical experience."
554	2009	NVSQ	38:04:00	Organizational Social Capital and Nonprofits	"Social capital has become a popular concept in nonprofit studies but, given confusion over its definition, it is not as widely used as it could be in organizational analysis. In addition, much of the social capital research in nonprofit studies focuses either on the role of nonprofits in fostering civic engagement or on the ways that nonprofits build social capital for individuals associated with the organization. This article has a different focus. It examines the role of organizational social capital in nonprofits"
555	2009	NVSQ	38:04:00	Gender and the Nonprofit Sector	"Numerous studies have found women to be more public spirited than men, volunteering more and giving a larger share of their income to nonprofits. Yet in the theoretical literature on the nonprofit sector, the role of women has been largely neglected. This article uses cross-national data to examine the relationship between women's empowerment, voluntary action and the nonprofit sector. I find a strong and positive relationship between women's empowerment, voluntary action, and nonprofit sector strength. These findings suggest a need for a gender theory that offers new insights into the nonprofit sector. If policy makers intensify their efforts to promote women's empowerment, this could not only increase equity but may strengthen the nonprofit sector. This, in a virtuous circle, could further help to promote women's empowerment."

In spite of more than 30 years history of the field, which we refer to here broadly as civil society studies, there is not one single term that covers the whole sphere. This article focuses on the different concepts and evaluates their content and connotations. It suggests that attempts to use categorizations should be replaced with the Wittgensteinian idea of family resemblance."
557	2009	NVSQ	38:04:00	Theories About the Role of Theory in Nonprofit and Philanthropic Studies	"As the nonprofit and philanthropic studies field achieves increased acceptance within colleges and universities, academics within the field must confront a conundrum: Most academics are inclined to develop academic programs that resemble the theory-oriented academic programs in which they were educated, most students who enroll in nonprofit programs, however, are current or future practitioners who are not preparing for and are unlikely to pursue academic careers in which theory development is a primary goal. The focus, here, is on two emerging perspectives on the role that theoretical knowledge should play in the nonprofit/philanthropic studies field and the implications of these perspectives for academic program development. One perspective is relatively traditional. The other requires a more radical rethinking of the form and function of theoretical knowledge in applied fields like nonprofit/philanthropic studies and a different approach to university preparation programs than the theory-dissemination approach found in traditional academic programs."
558	2009	NVSQ	38:05:00	The Effects of Descriptive Representation on Nonprofits' Civic Intermediary Roles: A Test of the Racial Mismatch Hypothesis in the Social Services Sector	"Social service organizations often act as civic intermediaries for their clients by facilitating their interactions with governing systems and political processes and institutions. Theories of descriptive representation and representative bureaucracy suggest that organizations will act in ways that advance the political interests of their clients when organizational leadership is racially reflective of the clientele served. Yet little is known about the effects of racial representation on nonprofit organizational activities. To what extent can these theories explain nonprofit organizational efforts to advance the political interests of their clients? This article examines this question using data from a sample of nonprofit service agencies in Michigan. Multivariate regression is used to examine the effects of racial representation on four civic intermediary roles performed by nonprofits: political representation, education, mobilization, and assimilation. Findings suggest that nonprofits engage in these activities at higher rates when agency leadership is more racially reflective of the clientele served."
559	2009	NVSQ	38:05:00	A Governance-Structure Approach to Voluntary Organizations	"This article develops a governance-structure theoretical understanding of voluntary organizations. Voluntary organizations are seen as governance structures reinforcing the norm of (generalized or balanced) reciprocity, making possible the pooling of resources based on the reciprocity principle. Voluntary organizations' governance structure presents some specific features in terms of formal ends, ownership, residual claims, decision-making procedures, accountability, checks and balances, control procedures, and embedded incentives facilitating collective action oriented toward public or mutual interest or toward advocacy. Because the voluntary governance structure is also compatible with several types of coordination mechanisms, voluntary organizations are able to operate in complex environments, mobilizing resources from market operations, governmental subsidies, or from reciprocity (volunteering, donations) while pursuing civic and democratic objectives. Their governance structure allows them to mitigate coordination failures and remain comparatively more efficient than other organizational forms. However, voluntary organizations may be subject to governance failures, the result of which could undermine trustworthiness and efficiency."

Using an agency theory framework, the authors explain how nonprofit boards are structured. Although nonprofits cannot disburse profits to their contributors, the role played by their boards of trustees in monitoring and advising managers is analogous to that of corporate boards of directors. Using a sample of Spanish foundations, the authors show that nonprofit board determinants, such as organizational complexity and financing structure, are similar in many ways to those of corporate boards. However, nonprofit age illustrates the different natures of these organizations and their voluntary boards."

This study identifies the importance of institutional facilitation of older adults in volunteer programs, especially for those of lower socioeconomic status. A questionnaire assessing the importance of institutional facilitation in volunteering was completed by 374 volunteers aged 60 years and older from a national sample. Institutional facilitation was measured by multidimensional items capturing role flexibility, compensation, recognition, and accommodation. Flexibility especially, choice of activities and ability to set own schedule was perceived as most important to volunteers. Low-income and non-White volunteers gave more importance to institutional facilitators of engagement. This study suggests that voluntary organizations can facilitate the inclusion of older adults from diverse backgrounds through increasing flexibility, compensation, and recognition."
562	2009	NVSQ	38:05:00	An Untapped Resource: Understanding Volunteers Aged 8 to 12	"Research on youth volunteers has overlooked those between the ages of 8 and 12 (younger youth). As a result, little is known about the volunteer activities, motivations, or barriers of youth this age. This study used semi-structured interviews with 73 younger youth from Boys and Girls Clubs in Atlantic Canada and 7 club executive directors to explore the contributions younger youth can make as volunteers and how their experiences differ from older youth volunteers. The findings indicated that younger youth can engage in a wide range of volunteer activities. They participate because they experience volunteering as fun and enjoy the rewards, both tangible and intangible, associated with volunteering. The most significant barriers are related to perceptions others have related to what younger youth can do as volunteers."

The current work is focused on the case of museums and arts organizations and analyzes the implications of three alternative strategic orientations (customer, sales, and custodial orientations) to improve social performance (education and conservation) as well as economic performance (income or number of visitors). The empirical analysis of 182 Spanish museums reveals that social performance is highly related to custodial and customer orientation, whereas economic performance depends mainly on a sales orientation."

This generates social capital to support an initiative-oriented collaboration framework among participants and across sectors. Such intersectoral initiatives are of paramount importance for the capacity of a region/community to set up innovative solutions to socioeconomic problems from the bottom-up, going beyond the limits of markets and government institutions. This is increasingly happening not only in depressed but also in developed regions and communities, such as Silicon Valley. This article reports on the Joint Venture: Silicon Valley Network, a nonprofit organization launched in 1992 to promote a series of intersectoral initiatives at the edge of the economy, society, and environment in Silicon Valley."
565	2009	NVSQ	38:05:00	The Relationship Between Confidence in Charitable Organizations and Volunteering Revisited	"Confidence in charitable organizations (charitable confidence) would seem to be an important prerequisite for philanthropic behavior. Previous research relying on cross-sectional data has suggested that volunteering promotes charitable confidence and vice versa. This research note, using new longitudinal panel data from the Netherlands, contradicts the suggestion generated by previous research. Volunteers indeed have more charitable confidence, but changes in one are not related to changes in the other. The authors identify generalized social trust and altruistic values as omitted variables that produce the previously observed relationship. The practical implication of this finding is that a decline in charitable confidence is unlikely to reduce volunteering. The theoretical implication is that volunteering is symbolic rather than instrumental."

The authors focus on the questions, do ethnic groups differ in their likelihood of volunteering, and are these differences a function of acculturation? The conceptual framework to explain formal volunteering includes acculturation, personal and social capital, gender, and age. Using logistic regression analysis, the authors find that acculturation explains formal volunteering only partially and differently among the groups and that each native-born and immigrant group has its own unique combination of predictors of volunteering."
567	2009	NVSQ	38:06:00	Immigrant Volunteering: A Stepping Stone to Integration?	"This article investigates volunteering by immigrants. It examines if and how volunteering experiences can attenuate the effects of relocation for immigrants as they seek to regain social and human capital lost in the migration process. Based on analysis of 754 surveys, 33 focus groups, and 34 in-depth interviews, the authors explore the volunteering experiences of immigrants in ethnic congregations in four Canadian cities. Using a grounded theory approach, they propose a conceptual framework that delineates factors at the individual and organizational levels. Although individual-level factors are useful determinants of volunteer participation, for immigrants organizational factors are also an important part of the picture. These factors influence immigrants' volunteer participation rates and the intensity of their participation. The benefits of volunteering include the enhancement of social and human capital, which provides a stepping stone for the integration of immigrants into the host society."

Intergenerational transmission of civic engagement activities was found to occur through mechanisms such as parental religiosity and voluntarism. Using multinomial logistic regression analysis, correlates of four types of civic engagement were examined: mixed motivation voluntarism (voluntary participation in activist and nonactivist activities, n = 401), exclusively activist (n = 109), exclusive voluntarism (n = 652), and as the referent noncivic minded (no voluntary participation in either activist or nonactivist activities, n = 1,309). Parental voluntarism, socialization, religious participation, education, and presence of children were found to be robust predictors of mixed motivation voluntarism, parental devotion, presence of children, and race/ethnicity, of exclusive activism, and parental religious affiliation and fundamentalism, socialization, and religious participation, self-perceived sense of trustfulness, presence of children, and race/ethnicity of exclusive voluntarism."
569	2009	NVSQ	38:06:00	The Collaboration Decision in Nonprofit Organizations: Views From the Front Line	"To understand the impact of collaborative service delivery by nonprofit organizations, scholars must fully understand why those nonprofits enter into service delivery collaborations and what motivates them to collaborate with another organization to deliver their services. Drawing on managers' retrospective accounts concerning the creation of interagency collaborations and applying multiple theoretical perspectives, this article explores what managers directly involved in collaborations perceive to be the rewards or benefits of those collaborations. This research demonstrates the multiple forces driving the formation of interagency collaborations, in particular the desire to secure benefits attached to service delivery and to secure benefits for the organization as a whole. Understanding why nonprofit managers enter into interagency service delivery collaborations will allow for scholars to better determine the full impact of those collaborations on both services and the nonprofit organizations engaged in the collaborations."

However, a weighted cross-sectional analysis of 18,469 respondents in the 2006 Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and data from respondents dying between the 2004 and 2006 HRS waves indicated that 88% to 90.5% of donors (>$500/year) more than the age of 50 will die without a charitable bequest. Cross-sectional probit analysis of the 2006 HRS and longitudinal conditional fixed-effects logistic analysis of the 1995-2006 HRS indicated that charitable estate planning was positively associated with age, wealth, education, religious attendance, volunteering, charitable giving, and the absence of children or grandchildren. In all specifications, the absence of children was a dominant predictor of charitable estate planning."
571	2009	NVSQ	38:06:00	The Stages and Strategies of Advocacy Among Nonprofit Reproductive Health Providers	"Research suggests that 501(c)(3) organizations play an active role in governance, shaping both the formulation and implementation of policy through advocacy. Previous work has, however, produced relatively inconsistent findings concerning the causes of and constrains on the advocacy function. In an attempt to reconcile these inconsistencies, this study draws on a theoretical model of strategic decision making in organizations, which suggests that decisions such as advocacy are best conceived of as a two-stage process. This approach produces the expectation that nonprofit organizations considering advocacy first decide whether the potential policy benefits are sufficient to undertake any form of political activity and then choose among the set of political tactics available to them. These hypotheses are tested in an analysis of the advocacy activities of more than 500 nonprofit reproductive health service providers."
572	2009	NVSQ	38:06:00	Building a Policy Fields Framework to Inform Research on Nonprofit Organizations	"Although the importance of the public policy environment for strategic action of nonprofit organizations has become increasingly clear, research on nonprofits is often divorced from their policy context. The purpose of this article is to present a theoretically informed framework for analyzing policy environments that can inform nonprofit research. Drawing on insights from political science, organization theory, public management, and nonprofit studies, the authors propose that the framework reflects a policy field that is an identifiable set of elements in a specific environment that directly shapes local public service provision. These elements include the structures created by institutions that deliver public programs and the ways in which state and local actors interact with and shape these structures as they work on public problems. Through a research example, the article presents the policy field framework's analytic steps."

They find that individuals are most likely to have board service in the same sector in which they have paid employment. Being older and having a do good orientation are associated with board service in all sectors. MPA degrees are connected to service on government boards, whereas MBAs are connected to service on business boards. Nonprofit boards do not show a preference for degree type. Years since graduate management education predicts nonprofit and government board service but not business board service. Only government boards seem to draw significantly more men than women from the pool of individuals with MBA and MPA degrees. The findings, consistent with resource dependence theory and the expected value of scholastic, social, and cultural capital, offer implications for board recruitment and future research studies"

Drawing on data collected as part of an ethnographic study in the Canadian nonprofit social services sector, this article explores the impacts of some of restructuring on professional, quasi-professional, and managerial employees in eight unionized, nonprofit social services. The data show that the adoption of social unionism has permitted some nonprofit social service workers to initiate new processes through which to have a voice in far-reaching social issues, sometimes in coalition with management and/or clients. The findings of this study point to the irrepressibility of the participatory spirit and its capacity to seek new forms and practices despite the stretched and restructured conditions of today's nonprofit social services sector."

The case shows that under state socialism, Brontosaurus appeared to conform to state mandates and societal expectations. However, its formal structure was decoupled from many activities to obscure its oppositional intent. After the transition to democracy, the organization was only able to maintain its place in society after it aligned its structure and practices with each other and openly expressed its alternative agenda. The findings demonstrate how social change and alternative lifestyle organizations vary their responses to institutional pressure in ways that enable them to realize their values and pursue their missions while accounting for the political and social contexts in which they are embedded"
576	2010	NVSQ	39:01:00	Why Not Partner With Local Government?: Nonprofit Managerial Perceptions of Collaborative Disadvantage	"Service delivery partnerships with local government offer both opportunities and challenges for nonprofit agencies, but the normative and institutionalist tendencies of the collaboration literature tend to downplay the rationales for avoiding partnerships and the influence of managerial characteristics on the decision to collaborate. Nonprofit executive directors across the state of Georgia were asked about factors that might inhibit them from collaborating with local government agencies. Principal components analysis created four dependent variables from these answers, which were regressed on various respondent, organizational, and community characteristics. The resulting analysis finds that managerial attitudes about collaboration are not monolithic: They reflect underlying political and social dynamics that should be understood as distinct constructs, linked to experience and personal background. The findings suggest that future research should specify the exact nature of collaborative barriers, examine the individual backgrounds of those charged with collaborative responsibility, and integrate theories of organizational and human behavior."

This report seeks to uncover some of the factors that explain how firms choose between competing social causes in the development of their CRM strategy. The behavior of firms traded on the London Stock Exchange is analyzed, by highlighting regularities and patterns in CRM activities. The rationales for the observed patterns are investigated through semistructured interviews with managers employed by UK-based nonprofit organizations, financial services, and retail firms. The authors identify, among other things, differences in the nature of the selected social causes, the length and geographical scope of the social campaigns, and the (CRM) strategies used to implement them. It is argued that these variations may reflect differences in the organizational legitimacy pressures experienced by firms in the retail and financial services sectors."

This article outlines a typology of donors and donations and using stakeholder theory and resource dependency identifies three external pressures (value incongruence, coalescence, and visibility) and two internal constraints (economic need and organizational commitment) that would entice a not-for-profit to adopt any one of three strategies: return the money and remove the public acknowledgment, keep the money but remove the acknowledgment, or keep the money and continue to honor the donor."

Yet little is known about what influences their human resource practices. After discussing how the strategic and human-resource-based theoretical approaches are appropriate for analyzing HRM in NPOs, the authors explore the current nonprofit literature to identify the specific characteristics of strategic orientations and human resources in NPOs. As a result, the authors propose an analytical framework that is differentiated into four HRM types. This framework enables a better understanding of the relationship between the specific characteristics of NPOs and the architecture of HRM."

Based on South Korea's unique context, the author makes significant modifications to Anheier and Salamon's ideas about religion. The author examines their four dimensions of the religions: an emphasis on charity and philanthropy, modularity, institutionalization, and autonomy. Regression analysis using data from the 1999-2002 World Values shows that Christianity increases individuals' civic engagement, while Buddhism does not have an impact on civic engagement. With respect to trust, neither religious affiliation influences individuals' interpersonal trust."
581	2010	NVSQ	39:01:00	Who Are Volunteers in Japan?	"Although Japan has a lower level of volunteering than many other countries, recent studies show slow but steady changes in its voluntary sector. Motivated by the scarcity of generalizable studies on volunteering among Japanese, the author examines the effects of demographic, socioeconomic, and social capital variables on the number of hours volunteered in Japan using data from the 2002 Japanese General Social Survey. Findings show that although demographic, socioeconomic, and social capital variables all help explain the level of volunteering, social capital variables appear to be stronger predictors than the other two types of variables. Religiosity is one of the most significant facilitators of volunteering, even though the large majority of Japanese do not practice organized religion. Frequent face-to-face contact with friends also increases volunteering hours. Most interestingly, individuals who interact more with foreigners volunteer more hours."
582	2010	NVSQ	39:02:00	On the Modern Meaning of Philanthropy	"The academic study of philanthropy presupposes a comprehensive definition that guides inquiry into what, exactly, philanthropy is and why it matters. At present, though, no such well-thought-out definition exists. Scholars tend to explore various facets of philanthropy, according to their particular academic interests, but without a comprehensive understanding of its full meaning. This article attempts to correct this lack of synoptic understanding by surveying prominent instances of usage and definitions of philanthropy in the modern era and synthesizing them into a overall framework for understanding its full modern meaning. In so doing, philanthropy is revealed to be a signal word, the evolution in the meaning of which reflects historically dominant philosophical and cultural trends in modern Western society. The subject of this article is further explored in a forthcoming article, to be published in the next issue of Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly, titled On the Classical Meaning of Philanthrªpa."
583	2010	NVSQ	39:02:00	Identifying Competencies of Volunteer Board Members of Community Sports Clubs	"This study contributes to the emerging empirical studies on roles and responsibilities of boards in nonprofit organizations by identifying competencies of volunteer board members. We identified how two types of constituents volunteer board members and sports members perceived competencies of volunteer board members in community sports clubs. We used the repertory grid technique to draw cognitive maps and to reveal the perceived reality of these constituents. Our results suggest that constituents within a group share similar perceptions of competencies of outstanding performing board members, whereas they agree less on perceptions of poor performing board members. This study reveals that cognitive (e.g., having a long-term vision, having professionalism), emotional intelligence (e.g., being reliable, being honest), and social intelligence (e.g., listening to others, being jovial/nice to be with) competencies are necessary to be perceived as an outstanding performing board member."

Whereas existing research has focused on the changing nature of volunteering, this study deals with the decision to quit volunteering and examines whether it may be considered part of the politics of self-actualization, that is, the more active and individualized monitoring of life. Former styles of volunteering and reasons for quitting were examined in a group of 99 ex-volunteers of the Red Cross in Flanders, Belgium, and volunteering habits were compared with a sample of 652 volunteers. Ex-volunteers did not systematically differ from the sample of volunteers with regard to their social background profile, volunteering behavior, and strength of organizational attachment. Furthermore, the decision to quit more likely reflected the routine nature of everyday practices than an autonomous and self-conscious life design."
585	2010	NVSQ	39:02:00	The Accountability Movement: What's Wrong With This Theory of Change?	"In the field of program evaluation, one of the first things evaluators often do to evaluate a program is to identify the theory of change behind the program and create a logic model to articulate why the program is expected to work. This allows evaluators to make an assessment about the expectations and feasibility of the program, as well as assess program implementation. In this article, the author uses the theory of change approach to evaluation and creates a logic model for the accountability movement or the tendency for funders to require nonprofit organizations to conduct evaluations and report performance information. The model is tested with empirical data, finding that the theory behind the accountability movement suffers from four design and implementation flaws well-known to evaluators: (a) unstandardized treatment, (b) confusion among targets, (c) coverage, and (d) intensity issues. The article concludes by offering insights and recommendations for improving accountability practices."
586	2010	NVSQ	39:02:00	The Sarbanes Oxley Act: More Bark Than Bite for Nonprofits	"Based on a survey of a representative sample of nonprofit organizations, this article explores the impact of the Sarbanes Oxley Act (SOX) on the nonprofit sector. The study addresses two questions: What is the level of SOX adoption by nonprofit organizations? and How do we explain variations in the adoption level of SOX? Using Poisson regression models, our study finds that the level of SOX adoption in nonprofit organizations is determined to a large extent by nonprofit organizations' accountability and transparency structure prior to SOX. When this factor is taken into account, contrary to previous studies, the level of SOX adoption by nonprofits is modest. In addition to the existing accountability structure, important variables in the statistical explanation of SOX adoption include CEOs' familiarity with SOX, attitudes of nonprofit CEOs toward SOX, and organization size."

A quality-loyalty model is proposed to explain funderMFI relationships. The role played by outreach and sustainability as perceived quality antecedents within a MFI has been studied. The model includes MFI transparency as an antecedent of trust. The proposed model is tested using a survey of 116 managers of MFI funding bodies. The analytical technique used to test the model is Partial Least Squares (PLS). The results suggest that both outreach and sustainability are important for MFI funders. The managerial implications for MFIs are discussed

This turmoil, combined with a push for integration within the larger Black community and among White liberals, made for an uncertain fundraising environment. In addition, this article explores Hampton Institute's decision to withdraw from the United Negro College Fund, a fundraising organization for private Black colleges, in 1968 and the impact of this action on Hampton's ability to raise necessary funds."

"We use national surveys of congregations conducted in 1998 and 2006-2007 to assess whether or not the faith-based initiative increased congregations' social service involvement, government funding, or collaborations with government or nonprofit organizations. More congregations indicated interest in social services and government funding in 2006-2007 than in 1998, but congregational involvement in social services, government funding, or collaborations has not increased since 1998. An in-depth local study of partnerships between congregations and nonprofit social service agencies leads to the same conclusion. The faith-based initiative did not change congregations' behavior or expand their role in our social welfare system because it overlooked congregations' longstanding role in community systems, and it was built on false assumptions about congregations' latent capacity to expand that role and the extent to which they constitute a meaningful alternative to existing organizational networks of social support"

Between 1960 and 2000, the typical nonprofit hospital shrank from being 3 times as large as the average for-profit hospital to being merely one-third larger. Analysis of aggregate hospital data implies that the convergence in capacity is replicated by the growing similarity between nonprofit and for-profit hospitals in the number of admissions and average lengths of stay. An analysis of hospital-level data reveals that the convergence was driven primarily by entry, exit, and ownership switches, rather than expansions or downsizing of existing hospitals. Further research is needed to uncover the driving forces that led to this growing similarity between nonprofit and for-profit hospitals."

At present, though, no such well-thought-out definition exists. Scholars tend to explore various facets of philanthropy, according to their particular academic interests, but without a comprehensive understanding of its full meaning. This article attempts to correct this lack of synoptic understanding by surveying prominent instances of usage and definitions of philanthrªpa in the classical Greek era and synthesizing them into a overall framework for understanding its full classical meaning. In so doing, philanthrªpa is revealed to be a signal word, the meaning of which significantly evolved to reflect historically dominant philosophical and cultural trends in classical Greek society. This article concludes the exploration of this subject begun in an article published in the previous issue of NVSQ, titled On the Modern Meaning of Philanthropy."

This article seeks guidance from the verses of the Quran and develops a theoretical model of charity-based Islamic microfinance institutions (MFIs), which can be used as an alternative approach to reduce poverty. The article argues that charity-based Islamic MFIs will be financially and socially sustainable as these are to be based on the concepts of brotherhood, local philanthropy, and volunteer services. Charity-based Islamic MFIs will provide money for consumption as well as production purposes and, thus, can broadly target the economic and social needs of the poorest of the poor. They can help minimize indebtedness and reduce unequal distribution of wealth in society."

This article develops a conceptual model to examine the different reasons why organizations would choose to invest in a membership-recruiting strategy despite the significant investment this strategy requires. The case study analysis of interest group associations in Israel confirms the hypothesis of an increased use of membership as an organizational strategy for building policy influence. The organizations are shown to be more interested over time in developing political leverage for influencing policy-making processes. Membership is viewed primarily as a strategy for rhetorical or symbolic legitimation for one organization, but even this organization uses membership as a tool for gaining greater leverage resources. Yet the findings are not optimistic regarding the focus on developing civic leadership."

This article considers the need to create three-dimensional maps of the sector matching populations of service providers with the intensities of public problems where they operate. It does so by providing a framework for understanding third-sector organizational service provision. It is illustrated by following a case of essential service provision in the face of state failure. It concludes by highlighting the utility of three-dimensional maps for policy makers."

Early Childhood Project	"This article examines the diffusion of a state-level nonprofit program to other states across the United States. Current literature on innovation diffusion largely overlooks the diffusion of nonprofit program innovation. Although several streams of related diffusion research have considered organizational change and government policy transfer, they miss organizational and contextual factors particularly important for nonprofits. This study considers organizational and environmental factors in the transfer of state-level nonprofit program innovation using in-depth interviews with 74 policy actors to examine the spread of the T.E.A.C.H. Early Childhood Project to nonprofits in four states. It identifies similarities and differences between nonprofit program and government policy diffusion and proposes a modified framework for state-level nonprofit program diffusion that consists of multiple stages and participant roles."

"This research adopts the utilitarian view of volunteering as a starting point: we posit that for an undergraduate student population volunteering is motivated by career enhancing and job prospects. We hypothesize that in those countries where volunteering signals positive characteristics of students and helps advance their careers, their volunteer participation will be higher. Furthermore, regardless of the signaling value of volunteering, those students who volunteer for utilitarian reasons will be more likely to volunteer but will exhibit less time-intensive volunteering. Using survey data from 12 countries (n = 9,482), we examine our hypotheses related to motivations to volunteer, volunteer participation, and country differences. Findings suggest that students motivated to volunteer for building their resumes do not volunteer more than students with other motives. However, in countries with a positive signaling value of volunteering, volunteering rates are significantly higher. As expected, students motivated by resume building motivations have a lower intensity of volunteering."

Organizations may hesitate, however, to assign volunteers to operate these systems, for a variety of reasons. This article reports an experiment testing the capacity of two types of volunteers traditionals (experienced in social services) and beneficiaries (from the ranks of the nonprofit's clientele)to use an IT for client services at two food pantries. The IT, Quick! Help for Meals, generates customized recipes and food-use tips about fresh vegetables. Results showed that both types of volunteers learned to operate the IT successfully. Traditionals' use of the IT proved as effective as paid staff's use in encouraging clients to consume more fresh vegetables. Beneficiaries' use of the IT was not as effective in changing clients' food use, compared to paid staff. Results of this case study should encourage nonprofits to experiment with assigning volunteers to operate ITs linked to client services."
598	2010	NVSQ	39:03:00	Exploring the Key Roles for Nonprofit Boards	"This research note explores roles for nonprofit boards as described by 121 community foundation executives. Through content analysis, a synthesized list of 13 different roles were identified. The study considered institutional and organizational attributes such as environmental uncertainty and organizational complexity to explore the contingencies under which certain board roles become more prevalent. The roles were also matched to existing governance theories. The list not only reflects activities recognized by different theoretical models but also suggests conflicts in the way strategy is conceptualized and articulated as a governance task."
599	2010	NVSQ	39:04:00	Does Performance Measurement Improve Strategic Decision Making? Findings From a National Survey of Nonprofit Social Service Agencies	"Nonprofits have encountered increased pressures for accountability and performance in recent years, both from their funding entities as well as the public. The adoption of performance measurement systems assumes that managers will use performance information to make better decisions. However, little research has focused on performance information use in the nonprofit sector. This study seeks to address this gap in the literature. Using survey data from several hundred nonprofit social service organizations in the United States, this article examines the extent to which reliance on various performance measures improves strategic decision making within nonprofit organizations. Authors find a positive relationship between the range of performance measures used by nonprofits and their level of effectiveness in strategic decision making. Other factors that also contribute to strategic decision making within nonprofits include effective governance, funding diversity, and education level of the executive director."
600	2010	NVSQ	39:04:00	Managing Expressive and Instrumental Accountabilities in Nonprofit and Voluntary Organizations: A Qualitative Investigation	"Various scholars have identified multiple sources of accountability in nonprofit and voluntary organizations (NPVOs) and have offered several typologies categorizing various streams of accountability. Only a few have attempted to offer strategies, however, to implement these differential forms of accountability. The study identifies multiple sources of NPVO accountabilities by engaging distinctions between these organizations' instrumental and expressive activities. From a qualitative study in 16 Chinese Canadian NPVOs, three forms of expressive accountability and two forms of instrumental accountability are distinguished. The study further develops a two-dimensional accountability matrix for categorizing organizations into four types according to their levels of commitment to expressive and instrumental accountabilities. Lastly, by associating organizational and managerial factors with the task of balancing the two accountabilities, the authors draw conclusions and offer implications for managerial practice."
601	2010	NVSQ	39:04:00	Exploring the Role of Funders' Performance Reporting Mandates in Nonprofit Performance Measurement	"I examine the extent of outcome measurement in nonprofit organizations and the relationship that outcome measurement has to funders' reporting mandates. Conclusions are derived from analysis of FY2002 survey and site visit data for 237 Detroit nonprofits and a comparison of FY2002 and FY2007 performance measures for 110 of those nonprofits that were subjected to new outcome reporting requirements instituted by the City of Detroit. Resource dependence and institutional theory frameworks are used to interpret the findings. The data support the conclusion that funders' outcome reporting mandates affect the extent of outcome measurement among nonprofits, even where resource constraints limited measurement prior to the mandates. Yet the impact is not universal. Further research to better understand the contextual factors that affect responses to measurement mandates is proposed."

This case study investigates the impact of these reforms on nonprofit human service organizations in Oregon, a state with a long history of performance activities. The authors pursue two research questions: (1) what impact did these reforms have on the performance and capacity of the nonprofit entities engaged in human services. and (2) what is the impact of the reported performance on the funding decisions made by the state legislature. The authors observe substantial improvement in the performance of the nonprofit organizations as well as increased capacity for their future performance. Somewhat surprisingly, the authors also observe that funding for programs with common performance measures received large increases in funding, whereas programs with unique measures were cut dramatically. The authors compare outcomes measurement from performance measurement, accounting, and evaluation perspectives and conclude with several suggestions for future research."
603	2010	NVSQ	39:04:00	Linking Collaborative Capacity to Performance Measurement in GovernmentNonprofit Partnerships	"This study uses the context of local government nonprofit partnerships to test the potential influence of various partnership and organizational factors on collaborative outcomes, using two contrasting outcome measures. Although the structural qualities of effective partnerships are fairly well understood, many of their informal and interpersonal qualities have not been captured in new governance research. These include, potentially, the strength of shared goals and trust built on prior joint experience. This study finds that formal contracts and prior experience working with nonprofits and volunteers can increase at least a public manager's perception of success, but the strongest association to real performance improvement comes from the intensity of shared goals and the level of investment in the partnership. The findings suggest the value in comparing multiple performance measures and also reinforce an understanding of the experiential, interpersonal factors that support collaborative success."
604	2010	NVSQ	39:04:00	"How Permeable is the Nonprofit Sector? Linking Resources, Demand, and Government Provision to the Distribution of Organizations Across Nonprofit Mission-Based Fields"	"A large vibrant nonprofit sector is often equated with a civically active and democratically inclined population. Yet, the degree to which different interests and needs are equally activated in a community's nonprofit sector remains unclear. This article argues that more than the number of nonprofit organizations, the distribution of organizations across nonprofit fields can better represent the plurality of the nonprofit sector and its relationship to democracy. If the sector represents a permeable sphere for the activation of interests through formal voluntary action, one should see a more even nonprofit landscape in communities where there is greater population heterogeneity. Using national data on nonprofit organizations to investigate the determinants of nonprofit heterogeneity in U.S. counties, findings indicate that the nonprofit sector is semipermeable. Although greater population heterogeneity does lead to a more evenly distributed nonprofit sector, resource dependency and resource inequality complicate this relationship."
605	2010	NVSQ	39:04:00	Street Credentials and Management Backgrounds: Careers of Nonprofit Executives in an Evolving Sector	"The nonprofit sector is confronting a potential leadership deficit and mounting pressures to become more efficient and businesslike. To begin to assess how these tensions influence pathways to leadership, this study investigates the professional backgrounds and nonprofit experience of leaders in the sector. Analysis demonstrates that some leaders have management credentials and management experience, but many advance in the nonprofit sector through substantive experience alone. Even though some nonprofit executives have spent most of their careers in the public sector or the business sector, the study also demonstrates that a nonprofit ethic matters a great deal for leadership. These findings suggest that substantive experience and dedication to the nonprofit sector constitute primary pathways to leadership in the sector, raising many questions about the role of management expertise and the evolution of leadership in the sector."

"This article argues that the concept of private government contributes to an elegant framework for understanding the public and private nature of American civil society. Private government has two distinct elements comprised of the interests of businesses and nonprofit organizations that exercise power to interact with government to achieve their specific goals and objectives. This new, yet familiar, lens on which to consider the role of the nonprofit sector in the United States and the manner in which it interacts with government policy makers and business decision makers adds clarity to the muddle of terminology scholars have assembled to classify and characterize one of American society's most distinguishing features. The article will be of interest to domestic and international scholars seeking yet another tool to compare nongovernmental organizations and the particular character of civil society in countries that do not have the same political traditions as the United States."
607	2010	NVSQ	39:04:00	Helping Them Live Until They Die: Volunteer Practices in Palliative Home Care	"Volunteers traditionally play an essential role in palliative care. Without them, many community and institutional programs would not survive. Despite the significant number of volunteers involved in palliative care, the nature and scope of their actions remain ambiguous. The blurred boundaries of their contribution create tensions between professionals, families, and volunteers with regards to patient care and sharing of responsibilities. This article reports on a comprehensive and descriptive qualitative study aimed at understanding volunteer practices in home palliative care in Canada through analysis of volunteers' discourse. The conceptual framework not only allows for a description of volunteer practices but also for an understanding of those practices in terms of the meaning volunteers ascribe to their actions and interactions. The information gathered provides a better understanding of the place of volunteers within the palliative care system, thereby allowing communities to optimize their contribution to the palliative care mission."
608	2010	NVSQ	39:04:00	A Comparison of Volunteering Data in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the Current Population Survey	"This article compares the volunteering data in the Center on Philanthropy's Philanthropy Module of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, generally referred to as Center on Philanthropy Panel Study (COPPS), and the September volunteering supplement of the Current Population Survey (CPS). In comparing survey methodologies, the author focuses on sample type and size, data collection procedures, response rates, and survey content. He also presents volunteering estimates from both datasets including an investigation of the uses of memory prompts and proxy responses for volunteering data. Both the COPPS and CPS volunteering data are high-quality datasets and each has relative advantages over the other. The COPPS data allow for longitudinal analysis and contain measures of charitable giving and religiosity, the CPS data's larger sample size allows for state-level estimates and subgroup analyses. In both datasets, proxy responses generally underreport volunteering. Memory prompts in the volunteering surveys capture small amounts of additional volunteering by White, married, middle-aged women with larger households."
609	2010	NVSQ	39:05:00	Beyond the Public Safety Net: The Role of Nonprofits in Addressing Material Hardship of Low-Income Households	"Research on material hardship mostly takes the public policy perspective, whereas the role of nonprofits in addressing household material hardship is largely ignored. This study uses data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation to examine what sources (government or nonprofit) households facing material hardships turn to for material assistance. Contrary to the common assumption that nonprofits play an increasing role in service provision after welfare reform, the data do not show a significant growth in service areas related to household material hardship. In the areas of comparison, government outweighs nonprofits in providing material assistance to low-income households, even without counting major public assistance programs. However, several findings show that nonprofits play a supplementary role in social service provision. Limitations and implications of the study are discussed."
610	2010	NVSQ	39:05:00	The Financing and Programming of Advocacy in Complex Nonprofit Structures	"This article examines nonprofit environmental groups to demonstrate the impact of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Federal Election Commission (FEC) regulation on nonprofit organizations interested in advocacy work. This regulation encourages nonprofits interested in extended advocacy to form additional, related tax-exempt entities, creating complex nonprofit structures. Although regulatory barriers to charitable lobbying have received some attention, little has been written on how regulatory policy shapes the organizational structures, finances, and programming of nonprofits involved in advocacy. This study analyzes the complex structures of five environmental nonprofit groups using information they file with the IRS and FEC and interviews with key officers and representatives. It finds that even with strict regulatory compliance, financial and programmatic relationships across these complex structures can vary creating different types of complex nonprofit structures. The article models the different complex nonprofit structures and provides an analysis of the historical and legal risk factors that underlie them."
611	2010	NVSQ	39:05:00	Top Management Team Diversity and Performance of Christian Churches	"This study investigates the relationship of top management team (TMT) diversity with performance of Christian churches, a particular type of nonprofit and voluntary organization. Performance measures were based on applying the balanced scorecard to the church setting. Within a sample of 82 churches from a single denomination, the authors found that greater diversity in the spiritual maturity and relationships of TMT members with the senior pastor was positively related with growth in church attendance. TMT diversity in age was positively related with Sunday school attendance. Surprisingly, diversity in TMT attitudes and tenure were positively related with efficiency of internal processes. Greater diversity in tenure in the TMT was negatively related with growth in church revenues. The findings suggest that diversity in the church TMT's may pay off in organizational growth, increased constituent learning, and better operating efficiency, but it may have negative impacts on growth in revenues. The findings related to efficiency suggest that TMT diversity may have different effects within nonprofit settings than it does within commercial business organizations."

The literature tends to focus on external forces, such as the changing nature of conflict and state funding, as an impetus for these NGOs to adopt peace-building mandates. However, this is not the complete story of mandate change. Typical explanations and theories used to explain the adoption of peace-building underemphasize the autonomy of NGOs and internal factors leading to mandate change. The cases of World Vision, Catholic Relief Services, and Mennonite Central Committee are used to reveal the overlooked factors contributing to adoption of peace-building mandates, including agency leadership and the importance of the compatibility of peace-building with the NGOs' primary missions as faith-based relief and development NGOs. Why NGOs engage in peace-building is an important question given the critiques they have received over their competency for the task."
613	2010	NVSQ	39:05:00	The Discerning Consumer: Is Nonprofit Status a Factor?	"The authors update and extend the research on consumer awareness of an organization's nonprofit status and test Hansmann's seminal contract failure theory. They explore consumers' abilities to identify nonprofits and their levels of trust in nonprofits as compared to for-profits and government organizations as well as their proclivity to patronize nonprofits as direct and indirect consumers. Data from a sample of 1,169 university students reveals that they are more likely to trust as well as volunteer and donate to nonprofits' than other types of organizations. In purchasing health care and education, they are also more likely to patronize nonprofits. However, most cannot spontaneously identify the status of well known nonprofits, and in this regard they did not differ from the front line staff working for those organizations."

About half (48%-50%) of the students at both points in time performed community service, of which about one tenth (8%-9%) was required by the student's college program. Having done community service in 2004, whether required or not, showed a statistically reliable relationship to having done community service in 2006. Results suggest that not all types of community service draw on the same capital or resources, offering possible directions for future methods to promote general and specific types of community service."

The framework is based on a recent review of the literature and highlights the ways in which internal organizational characteristics, board attributes, and the external environment influence board roles and responsibilities. In brief, our results confirm the importance of developing a more systematic body of knowledge about relationships between specific elements of context and board practices. The results suggest that the proposed contingency-based framework is a useful beginning point for future research."

Using Indiana as a case study, we first describe the distribution of nonprofits across these two listings. We then present findings from a small telephone survey of incorporated nonprofits that are not registered with the IRS for Indiana to explore whether they are excluded from the IRS-listing for statutory, technical, or compliance reasons. We consider several aspects of state incorporation status: date of incorporation and whether active status has been maintained or not. We conclude that researchers need to pay careful attention to the limitations of the IRS registration system when wishing to examine the dimensions of the nonprofit sector at local, state, or regional levels. Our finding, that some nonprofits fail to maintain active incorporation status, points to significant problems of nonprofit capacity."
617	2010	NVSQ	39:05:00	"The Emerging Role of Nonprofit Associations in Advocacy and Public Policy: Trends, Issues, and Prospects"	"The purpose of this article is to review the emerging role and development of state and national associations of nonprofit organizations. The question this article explores is, Do these associations increase the role of nonprofits in advocacy and participation in community decision making, and if so, to what degree do they help the sector exert influence in the public policy arena? Many nonprofit organizations in America are now joining state and national associations that specifically focus on building organizational capacity and training in policy advocacy. During the past decade, these associations have grown not only in number but also in strength, and now provide platforms for their members to collectively influence public policies at the local, state, and national levels. This article examines the roles and levels of advocacy and public policy by the National Association of Nonprofit Organizations (NCNA) and a few statewide nonprofit associations ranked by NCNA as high performers."

A model of management functioning and program performance is used as a structure for program staff to rate the relative importance of selected inputs (clients, staff, resources, etc.) and throughputs (management and service delivery processes, framed here as management and program capacity) as they affect results. Factors seen to be most important in affecting performance included adequate funding for the program, leaders having a positive attitude, staff being motivated and committed, a facilitative organizational structure, and a budgeting process which ensures effective resource allocation. Because performance measurement is seen as multidimensional and socially constructed, findings also include respondents' opinions on the most relevant measures of performance. These results can provide insights and guidance to researchers and agency managers regarding studying and improving organizational performance."

Using spatial analysis, this study examines the extent to which nine nonprofit organizations in Columbia, Missouri, meet the needs of their target populations. Findings revealed that nonprofit entities met from less than 1% to about 20% of client demand for services. Reactions to GIS analysis of program outputs was largely positive, with most of the nonprofits expressing an interest in using GIS technology to further communication and networking with other organizations. GIS is viewed by nonprofit administrators as a potentially useful tool in grant applications, strategic planning, program reporting, and advocacy activities, among others. Nonprofit administrators embrace GIS if they can use it to help with more immediate and practical concerns, such as improving client care and services."

Using a representative sample of 285 churches in Marion County, Indiana, this study investigates the relationship between race and social service provision and the potential impact on low-income communities. The findings of this study identify race as a significant factor in the type of social service delivery offered through faith organizations. Although several studies have identified social service activities, few studies consider specific economic activities. Although both African American and White faith organizations provide similar social service and educational activities, African American organizations are more likely to provide economic activities. These activities include employment services, job training, business development and assistance, and other economic activities that include credit repair, financial classes, and counseling"

Nonprofit self-regulation is expanding rapidly in Asia as an expression of collective action to defend against encroaching and increasing state pressures, to strengthen the quality of sectoral governance, services, financial management, and fundraising, to improve public, corporate, media, and other perceptions of nonprofits and charities, to organize an unruly sphere and marginalize lower quality actors or other outliers, to access governmental or donor funding, to act as a market mechanism to exclude competitive or unproductive actors for the benefit of remaining players or to marginalize organizations causing reputational damage to the sector, as a learning opportunity for nonprofits and their networks, and as a means to clarify and strengthen shared identity. This article analyzes the rapid development and forms of nonprofit self-regulation in Cambodia, India, Pakistan, and the Philippines and the motivations behind this rapid growth."
622	2010	NVSQ	39:06:00	Evolution of Nonprofit Self-Regulation in Europe	"This article explores the emergence of nonprofit self-regulation in long-established and emergent nonprofit sectors in Europe. An application of agency, resource dependence, and institutional theories to specific national cases reveals three predominant self-regulation types, compliance, adaptive, and professional models, conditioned on varied market, political, and social antecedents. The compliance system predominates in the Western European cases (Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Austria), where the nonprofit sector is long established and public regulation of the sector is weak. The adaptive model is evidenced in the United Kingdom, where the nonprofit sector is well established but self-regulation design shifts in response to changes in public regulation and the resource environment. The professional self-regulation type occurs when the nonprofit sector and its legal system both are emergent, as in Poland, with self-regulation emerging to shape philanthropic, civil society, and nonprofit practice. An analysis of the European context more broadly reveals that as self-regulation is emerging across a number of contexts, there is evidence of isomorphism."
623	2010	NVSQ	39:06:00	The Emergence of Nonprofit Self-Regulation in Africa	"This article examines the evolution of NGO self-regulation in Africa from 1990 through 2009 using cross-national data on 22 countries and more detailed case studies of 6 initiatives. The article uses collective action theory to characterize self-regulation as a collective endeavor in which organizations must find ways to develop and maintain common standards and mechanisms for monitoring and oversight. The article argues that self-regulation in Africa has unfolded in two generations. The first generation was a response to perceived threats of increased government regulation and resulted in systems of self-regulation that are national in scope and intend to produce a public good: national regulation. Second generation initiatives occurred in more liberal political environments, as a result, these second-generation initiatives often operate as a complement or supplement to government regulation. Second-generation self-regulation programs tend to have stronger standards and enforcement, but more limited organizational coverage, producing a private collective good for those nonprofits that are able to participate."

The study was based on a sample of 485 organizations that were tested according to the hierarchical and the two-step cluster methods. This generated five largely diverse strategic groups in the sector, and each group is thoroughly described in the article."
625	1990	VOL	01:01	Competition between non-profits and for-profits: entry and growth	"The non-profit sector in the United States relies on fee-paying individuals for a high proportion of its revenue. Given this fact, non-profits and for-profits coexist in the same industry when each type of firm can find a stable market niche that rewards its own special strengths: ideological commitment in the non-profit sector, access to capital and the profit motive in the for-profit. Coexistence is also possible when the non-profit form is superior but there is a shortage of non-profit entrepreneurs. The paper next considers the entry of non-profits into sectors dominated by for-profits. Here one must distinguish between purely commercial activities and those designed to further the charity's basic mission. In the former, non-profits should behave no differently than their for-profit competitors unless subsidies designed for mission-related activities are diverted to these activities. In the latter, the non-profits may have an advantage which reflects not 'unfair competition' but a judgment that their activities are worthy of subsidy. In evaluating competition between non-profits and for-profits, one must separate the issue of the appropriateness of an organization's tax-exempt status from the impact of its actions on for-profit firms."
626	1990	VOL	01:01	The possible role of the non-profit sector in Hungary	"A common feature of most non-profit theories is their concentration on the service-providing role of non-profit organizations, and the neglect of their redistributional role. At the cost of some simplification, there are two possible public policy responses to social inequalities: (1) the welfare state model with welfare redistribution under government control, and (2) the non-profit-based model  a large network of private organizations heavily supported by the government and complemented by government delivery of services. After 40 years of state socialism, Hungary now faces some important questions. What will be the role of the new voluntary sector? What are the possibilities of following the Western European route  a version of the welfare state model  or the American way  a non-profit-based model bolstered by 'third-party government'? The present Hungarian situation is ambiguous, we can find arguments for and against both. It is also argued that a mixed solution, some cooperation between the public and private sectors, is needed. The Western European, American and Hungarian experiences indicate that only a strong for-profit sector and a developed, harmonious government/non-profit partnership can ensure healthy social and economic development. The present Hungarian situation is far too complex and difficult to promise a fast and conflict-free establishment of this partnership. But both public institutions and government are acting in a way that may result in the development of a government-supported non-profit sector. There may be an opportunity for developing a 'Hungarian welfare state model'."
627	1990	VOL	01:01	Government/third-sector relationship in a comparative perspective: the cases of France and West Germany	"Both the private for-profit and the non-profit (or 'third') sectors provide what economists call public goods. The division of labor between these sectors, however, differs substantially across countries in terms of both qualitative and quantitative dimensions. Such cross-national differences are illustrated in the present paper with respect to France and West Germany. The autonomy of the state, the nature of the dominant actors and their style of interaction are identified as crucial variables shaping the linkage patterns of government/third-sector relationship. The cross-national comparison allows for the hypothesis that different patterns of government/third-sector linkages also shape different degrees of institutional adaptiveness in a changing political and economic environment."
628	1990	VOL	01:01	The role of voluntary social welfare organizations in Norway: a democratic alternative to a bureaucratic welfare state?	"Taking as a point of departure the postulated political-ideological and fiscal crisis of the welfare state, this article emphasizes recent changes in the relationship between the four sectors of welfare providers: the informal sector of the family or community, the for-profit sector  where social goods are offered by profit-seeking institutions, the formalized sector of voluntary organizations, and the public sector of statutory bodies. Discussion is concentrated on the changing relationship between the voluntary and public sectors. Are voluntary organizations able to cope with new and extensive welfare problems within a more decentralized welfare state? Do they express the values, and do they possess the resources that both governmental agencies and the organizations themselves take for granted?"
629	1990	VOL	01:01	"Non-profit, for-profit and government organizations in social service provision: comparison of behavioral patterns for Austria"	"This paper investigates behavioral differences between non-profit organizations (NPOs), government organizations (GOs), and private market organizations (PMOs) as suppliers of nursery schools and retirement homes. On the basis of Weisbrod's undersupply model, the differentiated demand approach, and the public finance argument on the redistributive role of government, three hypotheses are theoretically specified and empirically tested: client differentiation, product differentiation, and price differentiation. NPOs and PMOs are shown to provide qualitatively better services and charge significantly higher prices than GOs. A clustering of clients with similar socio-economic backgrounds can be observed: GOs provide services for clients with lower economic and social status than private suppliers. GOs, holding more than two-thirds of the respective markets, are responsible for a 'basic provision' of services, they pursue distributional goals by producing services themselves, only rarely a 'contracting out' to private suppliers can be noted."
630	1990	VOL	01:01	Voluntary welfare associations in Germany and the United States: theses on the historical development of intermediary systems	"This research note presents several comparative theses on the historical development of voluntary and non-profit welfare associations in Germany and the United States. The major argument is that voluntary and non-profit associations in both countries share one common root: the secularization and socio-political consequences of the enlightenment. However, voluntary welfare associations in Germany and the United States have developed along radically different lines, due to their distinct political embeddedness in society. Following periods of divergence in which the German voluntary action emphasized 'state orientation', and its American counterpart 'market orientation', the two countries have entered a new period of convergence."
631	1990	VOL	01:02	Mapping the non-profit sector in the United States: implications for research	"The need for a national typology of the US non-profit sector has long been recognized. A typology which could better define and describe the variety and diversity of non-profit organizations by type or major function will serve numerous research and public policy uses. This article describes the essential elements of the National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE), developed over almost a decade after extensive consultation with agencies in the non-profit sector and the United States government. The article reports an initial analysis of the classification of nearly one million non-profit organizations in the US, and comparisons are made with earlier estimates in Dimensions of the Independent Sector. Based on these findings, changes are proposed to this biennial statistical profile of the US non-profit sector. The importance of developing national typologies of non-profit organizations is discussed as a basis for comparative international research."
632	1990	VOL	01:02	"Change and continuity in British voluntary organizations, 1976 to 1988"	"A cohort of twenty British national voluntary agencies serving handicapped people was studied in 1976 and again in 1989 after a decade of major shifts in public policy. Changes and continuities were identified in income, structure, governance, management, program, interorganization relations and advocacy. A consistent pattern of growth, bureaucratization and professionalization was found, with relatively little change in the dominant mode of financing, statutory or philanthropic. A three-stage model is proposed to describe the development of British voluntary agencies since the 1970s, and some of the organizational implications of current policies for the 1990s are noted."
633	1990	VOL	01:02	Taxes and giving: new findings	"This paper surveys 24 studies, appearing since Clotfelter's (1985) book, which estimate the influence of tax incentives on personal donations in three countries. Studies employ new surveys, experimental data, and data corrected for tax evasion. Newly available panel data sets obtain conclusions which strongly challenge the traditional consensus that tax incentives are a powerful stimulus to giving. The paper also surveys theoretical developments. In particular, the traditional test for efficiency (price elasticity exceeding unity) is not generally appropriate."
634	1990	VOL	01:02	The variability of individual charitable giving in the US	"Using five-year panel data, this study examines the various dimensions of the variability of individual charitable contributions at all income levels: the variation in the generosity of individuals and the variability of the individuals giving over a five-year period. The study finds considerable variability of both kinds. One finding is that the variability of generosity is substantially greater at the higher income levels. Another finding is that variability is substantially less pronounced by observing a five-year period of an individual's generosity than by observing annual behavior. One consequence is that a relatively small proportion of donors account for a large proportion of total giving. The popular reputation of the wealthy for generosity is actually due to the exceptional generosity of a minority rather than widespread generosity among the wealthy. Differences in generosity and variability of giving over time are both more pronounced among high-income donors. Results of the study have implications for research on charitable giving, for predicting the effects of tax policy changes on giving, and for fund-raising."
635	1991	VOL	02:01	Tax policy toward non-profit organizations: an eleven-country survey	"The role of private non-profit organizations in modern economic systems is poorly understood. The tax and subsidy treatment of non-profits relative to private firms affects the competitive position of each, and thus their relative strength within any industry, in the United States, for example, non-profit organizations play major competitive roles in such industries as hospitals, nursing homes, day care centers, schools and arts organizations. This paper reports results from a survey of tax policies toward non-profit organizations in eleven countries. The major findings are: (1) the definition and scope of such organizations varies considerably, (2) non-profit organizations are typically regulated by the tax collection agency, but in some countries there is also involvement from the government agency responsible for the particular realm of activity, such as health or education, (3) tax subsidies to non-profits take many forms  not only exemption from corporate profits tax but, depending on the country, for land, buildings, mail and motor vehicles, (4) almost every country limits non-profit organizations 'unrelated' business activities, and (5) donors are generally permitted to deduct donations of money from taxable income, although there are typically both minimum and maximum limits. These findings point up the larger task of understanding why such differences exist across countries, and what are the effects."
636	1991	VOL	02:01	Non-government development organizations and the grassroots in Peru	"This paper examines the long-term grassroots empowerment strategies endorsed by non-governmental development organizations (NGDOs) in Lima, Peru and their application in concrete development programs. An examination of NGDO literature and projects permits the synthesis of three ideal-typical empowerment strategies (Neo-Marxist, Neo-Anarchist, Coalition-Building). These strategies are described and compared, especially with respect to their diverging conceptions on processes of 'bottom-up' development, the characterization of grassroots mobilization and the role of the state and political parties. These differences, however, tend to be compromised once actual advocacy work with the grassroots is contemplated, when development projects have to deal with the micro-mobilization patterns of the poor and the political conjuncture. Several interpretations of the contradiction between ideal-typical strategies and actual advocacy tactics are discussed, concluding that such contradictions are inherent to any political process based on grassroots empowerment and a 'bottom-up' agenda."
637	1991	VOL	02:01	The voluntary sector and corporate citizenship in the United States and Japan	"This paper explores the differing approaches and objectives of Japanese and American philanthropy, as well as aspects of corporate giving and corporate citizenship. The historic roles of philanthropy, and the scope and purposes of the non-profit sector in both countries are examined, as is the concept of corporate good citizenship and the tendency towards giving by individuals and corporations. In addition, the paper examines the differing tax treatments, such as deductibility of charitable gifts, tax exemption of organizations, and relation of exempt entities to government, that logically follow from the two approaches, including changes in law and regulation through to the end of 1990. Although written by an American, this paper is not intended to present American-style philanthropy as a model for any others. Rather, it is intended to provide useful information for comparative study and to express the hope that Japan will bring a fresh approach to philanthropy around the world that goes beyond giving to traditional American causes and purposes and beyond giving solely as an export product used as a means of easing trade and investment friction."
638	1991	VOL	02:01	The non-profit sector in East Germany: before and after unification	"The paper describes how the non-profit sector in East Germany has passed through several distinct phases in recent years. It shows how the role of the non-profit sector under the system of party dominance and centralized economic and social planning signified a major contradiction of East German society: the artificial under-development of civic society in eastern Europe's most successful economy. During the first phase of the transition period in late 1989, the expression and manifestation of political views was predominant. With the disintegration of the socialist party-state, the needs for social service provision increased. West German organizations have increasingly become the dominant factor in East German non-profit sector affairs. The paper argues that the East German non-profit sector will emerge as a slightly poorer and more secular version of its West German counterpart."
639	1991	VOL	02:01	Non-profit enterprise and Soviet economic reform	"This paper explores the roles that the public and private non-profit sector can play in the economic reform process in the Soviet Union. Using a taxonomy based on earlier work on the economic theory of the non-profit sector, it specifies which types of institution might be appropriate for doing so. It does so in a way that broadens the neo-classical economic model and puts it in perspective."
640	1991	VOL	02:02	Altruism and culture as social products	"The historical core of the independent sector is comprised of churches, charitable organizations and higher education. What distinguishes these and other independent sector organizations from the governmental and commercial sectors is the fact that participation in the independent sector is free from state compulsion and not for the purpose of monetary gain. The independent sector is a modern development which could not have occurred without the disestablishment of religion. Disestablished churches have given rise to secular charities, higher education and other independent sector organizations in the United States. The independent sector is the arena in which cultural production and altruistic activities with a distinctive moral quality take place. Participation in the independent sector is the only mechanism for status legitimation in a democratic society with no compulsory state religion or traditional forms of authority."
641	1991	VOL	02:02	The politics of NGO development in China	"Since the beginning of reform in the late 1970s, the non-governmental sector in China has burgeoned. This paper analyses its development. It begins by examining competing theories regarding the political impact of the NGO sector. Political scientists employing pluralist or civil society approaches suggest that the development of NGOs is an important force in creating pressures for democratization. In contrast, those employing a corporatist framework seek to illuminate the mechanisms which the state can use to limit and control the political impact of NGOs. The paper also examines the advantages and disadvantages of close state involvement for the impact of NGOs on socio-economic development. It explicates the legal and regulatory framework for NGOs in China in order to illustrate the ways in which the state seeks to preempt and coopt the formation of autonomous organizations, lending support to the corporatist interpretation. The paper includes case studies of NGOs based on interviews with representatives of NGOs and regulatory organs, published documents and press reports. It places China's contemporary experience with non-governmental organizations in context by comparing it with associational life in traditional China, in developing countries in general, and in communist countries in particular. Finally, the paper analyses the significance of the economic reforms and the impending political succession for NGO development."
642	1991	VOL	02:02	The NGO sector in India: historical context and current discourse	"The last two decades have witnessed a veritable mushrooming of NGOs in India. What, however, is inadequately appreciated is that the conversion of voluntarism into primarily a favored instrumentality for developmental intervention has changed what was once an organic part of civil society into merely a sector  an appendage of the developmental apparatus of the state. Further, this process of instrumental appropriation has resulted in these agencies of self-activity losing both their autonomy and political-transformative edge. What is required, therefore, is to reorientate voluntarism from a framework of subserving the needs of delivery to one promoting self-governance in the widest sense."
643	1991	VOL	02:02	The voluntary sector in 'the information society': a study in division and uncertainty	"At a time of rapid social, political and economic change in Britain, voluntary and community groups are being encouraged to assume a more prominent role in general welfare provision. Accordingly, their 'need to know' has never been more acute. Yet the information environment of the voluntary sector is also in a state of flux and transition. Profound changes in the institutional world of information provision hold significant implications for the way voluntary and community groups seek and disseminate information. In this paper these structural changes are outlined and the findings presented of an extensive investigation into information needs and usage in the voluntary sector."
644	1991	VOL	02:02	The promise of non-profits in Poland and Hungary: an analysis of third sector renaissance	"The non-profit sector arising in Poland and Hungary bears little resemblance to its pre-war ancestors. The new non-profits are shaped by social and economic forces brought about by the state socialists. State socialist service policies have left the non-profits with substantial need for their services, but the organizations face several major constraints in meeting that demand. Current government policies towards services and non-profits are discussed. Government and foreign funders can play a significant role in fostering the new non-profits, but a careful prioritization of objectives is necessary. The present situation shows that many theories about non-profit organizations are not internationally cross-applicable, although several hypotheses have partial relevance."
645	1992	VOL	03:01	Organizing principles for international advocacy associations	"Recent decades have witnessed a significant increase in the number of voluntary non-profit associations established to address solutions to major international social problems. Many of these associations concentrate on advocacy work, as opposed to service delivery, and are international in scope rather than based in a single country. This paper is concerned with the challenges to organizing this particular type of voluntary association. While rapid progress in communications and transportation technology has undoubtedly facilitated the development of these associations, such organizations still face formidable problems. The paper argues that international advocacy associations are successful when they adopt particular organizational structures and strategies to accommodate these problems. In particular, decentralized and federated structures appear to be more viable for the international advocacy arena. This paper reviews relevant literature and elaborates on the theoretical expectations for successful structuring of international associations devoted to advocacy on global issues. Hypotheses are set forth and investigated in a preliminary way through the examination of case studies of three associations."
646	1992	VOL	03:01	Governing the voluntary sector response to AIDS: a comparative study of the UK and Germany	"The impact of AIDS on Western polities serves as a useful indicator both of social values and of political and organizational relationships. At the same time, community-based nonprofit organizations have been at the forefront of AIDS policy-making and service development. Taking Britain and Germany as case studies, this paper discusses similarities and differences in the functions accorded to the voluntary sector in the pattern of responses to HIV and AIDS. Typical problems confronted by emergent voluntary sector welfare agencies are noted and particular features of AIDS service organizations described. Separate accounts are then given of the development of a federated network of AIDS service organizations (ASOs) in Germany and of contrasting experience in the UK. While governments have shared a concern to confine the activity of ASOs to serving the needs of those groups directly affected by AIDS, other significant differences in policy development may be attributed to differences in the organizational structure of the health sector."
647	1992	VOL	03:01	Non-profit-funding environment relations: theory and application	"The relationships between funding heterogeneity and organizational structure and functioning were examined for a panel of non-profit organizations. Resource dependence and institutional theory were used to derive hypotheses predicting positive associations between funding heterogeneity and non-profit boundary spanning, modeling and participation in collective efforts. For non-profits which were less vulnerable to institutional aspects of their environments, funding heterogeneity was found to have a positive effect on boundary spanning, consistent with resource dependence theory. For non-profits which were more vulnerable to institutional factors, on the other hand, funding heterogeneity was found to have positive effects on modeling and participation in collective efforts, consistent with institutional theory. These results argue that resource dependence and institutional theory need to be combined for the analysis of organization-environment relations and suggest how this could be accomplished."
648	1992	VOL	03:01	Decision-making processes in community transport organizations: a comparative case study of service providers	"Transport services provided by voluntary organizations have grown dramatically in recent years. However, little systematic research has been undertaken on the functioning of these organizations. The aim of the research on which this paper is based was to rectify the lack of information on how decisions relating to service provision are made by such organizations  often called 'community transport' (CT) operators. Three organizations were selected for a comparative case study approach. The results show that the leadership approach of their key staff was of particular significance. Each organization is moving in the direction of greater professionalism and away from its community roots. This cultural change can be attributed to responses to external forces, especially those affecting resources. Evidence suggests they are being forced towards adopting practices of the private sector, but that this need not be the case. Community transport provision is in a period of transition, the outcome of which may radically alter both its structure and its survival capacities."
649	1992	VOL	03:01	"Comment on Stephen M. Wunker, 'the promise of non-profits in Poland and Hungary: an analysis of third sector renaissance'"	"The pre-war Hungarian voluntary sector was relatively weak as a service-provider, but played major social and political roles, and was an important vehicle of the self-organization of society. That is why state socialist governments could develop the nationalized system of social services quite easily, but could not completely destroy citizens autonomy, solidarity and private initiatives. Both the pre-war traditions and the social and economic forces brought about by state socialism are of crucial importance in shaping the newly emerging Hungarian non-profit sector. The traditional government/non-profit partnership may be the basis for contracting out state-financed public services. At the same time, voluntary organizations are expected to plug the gaps present in the state socialist service system. Large government-funded non-profit organizations may play an important role in the denationalization process, some of them can be appropriate means of assuring that the grant making procedure remain free from politicization."
650	1992	VOL	03:02	In search of the non-profit sector. I: The question of definitions	"In this paper we argue that the lack of attention to the third sector historically is primarily a result of the weakness and limitations of the concepts that are used to define and describe it. The purpose of this article is to remedy this situation by developing a general definition of the sector that can be used in comparative research. To do so, the article first identifies four alternative types of definitions that are potentially available and evaluates each in terms of three basic criteria. On this basis it concludes that the most useful definition is the 'structural/operational' one, which includes in the non-profit sector organizations that share five basic characteristics. These are: formal, private, non-profit-distributing, self-governing and voluntary. The basic definition is then tested against the realities of three disparate countries and found to perform quite well. On this basis we recommend the structural/operational definition, particularly for comparative, cross-national research."
651	1992	VOL	03:02	Ideology and welfare in the UK: the implications for the voluntary sector	"The UK has, over recent years, moved from a welfare state to a more market-oriented system of welfare. But the extent of this change has varied considerably according to the ideological position of local government in different parts of the country. This makes it possible within one country to assess the implications for the voluntary sector of different models of welfare. This article develops a framework for looking at different welfare ideologies and the values they espouse, with reference both to the UK and to the models that exist in other countries. It then takes four examples of UK local authorities which demonstrate the different models and examines the implications for the voluntary sector. In doing so, it examines the prospects for the voluntary sector to deliver both service and political pluralism in the future."

Specifically, three questions are addressed. What type of voluntary organizations existed at what periods of history, and what were their primary activities? Who were the founders, and what were their motives? Can we detect common themes or underlying patterns in the way in which the Indian voluntary sector has developed? Or in other words: what is the institutional genesis of the non-profit or voluntary sector in India? The findings are based on multiple sources  literature review, interviews and observation, and information requested through the mail. The article differs from most historical studies on Indian non-profit organizations because it takes an analytical approach by drawing from contemporary literature on such organizations."
653	1992	VOL	03:02	Using the lessons learned from US and English law to create a regulatory framework for charities in evolving democracies	"The evolving democracies of Eastern Europe and the former USSR republics are keenly interested in establishing charities. They have little law on this issue because their former governments did not encourage the development of charities. This article compares US and English regulation of charities and proposes a regulatory framework based on what the authors believe are the best attributes of both. Although the framework is based on the common law system, it can be adapted to the civil law systems of the Eastern European nations and the former USSR republics. The article includes such issues as developing a body of law, tax relief and creating a regulatory agency."
654	1992	VOL	03:02	European competition law and the non-profit sector	"Although there has been a debate in the USA for more than two decades about competition policy and non-profit organizations, the debate has not yet had the same prominence in Europe. Only in the last few years, even in the USA, has anti-trust policy toward the sector been examined. The paper examines the position for two groups of competition issues in European Community law: first, the problem of the lawfulness of grant aid, given the rules against state subsidies distorting competition, and second, the application of the rules for competition in the single market including EC anti-trust law. Particular legal problems are identified for non-profits which use geographical catchment area agreements with similar organizations. Finally, the paper examines a range of policy issues which arise on consideration of Community law, including the idea of community development as a locally autarchic objective, the terms of competition for grants and contracts, and the possible implications of the future application of European competition law to non-profits in the Community."
655	1992	VOL	03:03	In search of the non-profit sector II: The problem of classification	"Building on a previous Voluntas article (Salamon and Anheier, 1992b), which formulated a systematic approach to defining the non-profit sector for purposes of comparative research, this article takes on the complementary task of formulating a classification system that can be used to differentiate systematically the types of non-profit organizations that exist at the global level. To do so, the article first assesses a number of existing classification systems, such as the International Standard Industrial Classification and the National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities. Finding these systems inadequate, the article then introduces an alternative system, which we term the International Classification of Nonprofit Organizations (ICNPO). The ICNPO classifies non-profit establishments into 12 major groups based on their primary economic activity, and then further sub-divides these into 24 sub-groups. The result is a system that scores high in terms of five key evaluation criteria: economy, significance, rigor, organizing power, and richness. What is more, initial tests of the ICNPO in a set of countries show that it performs well in coming to terms with the diverse types of non-profit institutions that exist around the world."

The verdict was critical of the charity, and publicly threatened trustees with sanctions in the event of a recurrence of political abuse. However, the outcome cannot be claimed as an important victory for right-wing political forces in their campaign to end what in their view is an unacceptable left-wing political bias in some of the country's leading charitable agencies. Organizations like Oxfam will be able to continue to participate in the political arena. Nevertheless, they face awkward dilemmas concerning their relationships with government, at a time when their own understanding of third world problems and increasing pressure from their overseas partners urge them to take on the mantle of a pressure group."
657	1992	VOL	03:03	Philanthropy without borders: US private foundation activity in Eastern Europe	"Worldwide disillusionment with governmental problem-solving, decline in governmental resources, increasing prominence of multinational corporations, and the collapse of communism act as powerful stimuli to international philanthropic activity. US private foundations in particular have been highly motivated by the collapse of communism to act as venture capitalists in seeking grant-making opportunities and philanthropic partners in Eastern Europe. International philanthropy of private foundations can provide expertise in and resources for global as well as regional or local problem-solving. However, resources available must be viewed realistically. This paper puts available foundation resources in perspective. Further, international philanthropy by private foundations is no panacea for the world's problems, and may only be effective at the margins. But to the extent it can be an effective problem solver, it should not be artificially limited by boundaries and laws of any one nation, as it is at present. While reviewing some trends towards increasing activity of larger US private foundations in Eastern Europe, this paper also illustrates small segments of the existing legal, tax and other barriers to international philanthropy. In many instances, simple awareness of some of these barriers will enable potential grantees and philanthropic partners to surmount these barriers. But within the larger context of globalization of philanthropy, all such barriers to the free movement of philanthropic capital and expertise should be identified and ultimately removed so that international philanthropy, like international trade and free movement of capital and goods, can emerge to an optimal level."
658	1992	VOL	03:03	"Comment on Stephen M. Wunker, The promise of non-profits in Poland and Hungary: an analysis of third sector renaissance"	"Both the pre-war tradition and the real socialist system have influenced the form of the non-profit sector emerging in Poland. In as much as the pre-war traditions are continued by the church charities, lay institutions are established on the basis of state structures in the form of specific non-profit organizations subsidized to a large extent by the state (the so-called 'non-profit social institutions'). Perhaps in this way partnership relations will develop between the government and nonprofit organizations which will continue to expand. The stage through which Poland is currently passing means that a coherent system of non-profit organizations has not yet developed and, what is more, it is seldom called a 'voluntary' or 'third' sector. The only formalized institutions are foundations and associations. It is evidently necessary to fill the gap in social service provision caused by government and market failures, and we may cherish a hope that such a system of non-profit organizations providing services to those in most need will soon be created in Poland."

"Over the past two years, a loosely-formed group known as the Company Giving in Europe Initiative has been examining the prospects for corporate social responsibility in the increasingly competitive marketplace of the European Community post 1992. As firms capitalize upon the EC's unerring commitment to remove the fiscal, technical and physical barriers to intra-Community trade, many observers are confident that progressive companies will extend their charitable giving programs in order to mirror their commercial aspirations. A recent study commissioned by members of the Initiative argues that opportunities for increased corporate social responsibility are a consequence of changed political circumstances as much as of improved market conditions (Dabson, 1991). This paper explores this premise and argues that there are still certain changes of policy which the EC institutions could make to maximize the potential of corporate giving."

Subsidies to local associations are an important vehicle for the central government in managing its decentralization policy. Based on a locality sample, data on subsidies to associations were collected in nearly 400 municipalities. Results show that the allocation of subsidies is highly uneven, and part of a complex network in which private non-profit services are linked to the services that were previously part of the public sector. Implications for the French non-profit sector and for the government's decentralization policy are discussed."
661	1993	VOL	04:01	Voluntary organizations and the welfare state: the case of Norway	"Taking as the point of departure the political-ideological and fiscal 'crises of the welfare state', this article emphasizes recent changes in the relationship between voluntary organizations and the public sector in Norway, changes that open up new space for the voluntary sector both ideologically and as a service producer. We question whether voluntary organizations are able to cope with new and extensive welfare problems within the more decentralized welfare state. Do they express the values, and do they possess the resources that both governmental agencies and the organizations themselves take for granted? As part of that discussion, the article questions the dominant view within the literature, namely that Scandinavia has a very weak voluntary sector. We argue that 'state-friendly' Norway has a rather strong voluntary sector, that this sector is of a specific type, and that both of these factors have important theoretical implications not only for Scandinavia, but for an overall understanding of the voluntary sector."
662	1993	VOL	04:01	Institutional constraints on executive greed: stratification systems in American art museums	"This paper examines the stratification systems of over 200 organizations, individually represented by the internal income distributions of each organization, in turn seen as products of executive decision-making. As a first principle, I assume that in any decision-making situation in which organizational leaders must choose between their own welfare and the welfare of their employees, they will almost always select the selfish course of action. In accordance with this axiom of executive greed, the majority of intra-organizational income distributions exhibit a substantial positive or right skew (that is, many people in the lower income levels and very few in the highest). Yet there is sufficient variation to suggest that there are forces which constrain executive greed. Combining the 'new structuralist' perspective on stratification with resource dependency and organizational fields models, the paper examines hypotheses which maintain that the shape of internal distributive systems is affected by: (i) organizational properties, such as size and structural complexity, which empower the employee in labor relations with management, and (ii) highly-institutionalized resource dependencies which constrain income disbursement decisions. Data are taken from a US sample of art museums. The results of the analyses seriously contradict the new structuralist's empowerment accounts of the effects of size and structural complexity on stratification, and suggest that their propositions have been posed at a level which may be far too general. Certain highly-institutionalized resource dependencies are found to promote equality in internal distributive systems."

In contrast, there are practically no empirical investigations into labor-management relations in third sector institutions. The largest share of this sector in Germany is represented by the two Christian churches with presently about 900,000 employees. According to the notion of church officials, labor-management relations in these institutions are characterized by a specific normative concept which emphasizes a trustful co-operation of all employees in the mission of the church. The major concern of our research project focused on the question whether the specific conditions of employment within church institutions favor more hierarchical or more co-operative forms of co-ordination and how employees and employee representatives perceive the 'ideal of the community of service' (Dienstgemeinschaftsgedanke). The results of our research lead to the conclusion that church labor-management relations are characterized by a remarkable contrast between the participative or co-operative notion of the ideal of the 'community of service' and present forms of hierarchical co-ordination inside church institutions."
664	1993	VOL	04:01	The NTEE classification system: tests of reliability/validity in the field of higher education	"An analysis of the field of higher education reveals a surprisingly large number of classification errors within the (US) National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities database. Of the nearly 4,000 non-profit entities coded within the universe of institutions of higher education, we estimate that approximately 60 per cent were incorrectly included (Type II errors). Institutions incorrectly excluded from the higher education universe (Type I errors) represent roughly 10 per cent of the institutions coded correctly. These errors result primarily from assigning codes on the basis of the names of organizations (for example, 'College Park Towers' is classified as a college, when it is in fact a housing complex for senior citizens) and from trying too hard to assign codes in ambiguous situations. The consequences can be significant for the users of these data, and we recommend raising bright warning flags while simultaneously enlisting the help of the entire non-profit sector in improving the classification coding process."
665	1993	VOL	04:01	Theory and reality in the vision of Adriano Olivetti	"This article describes and analyses the ideas and activities of the Italian industrialist, Adriano Olivetti (1901 1960). Although by most interpretations of the term philanthropy, Olivetti would be considered a philanthropist, Italians have not viewed him in that way, and outside of Italy his 'philanthropic' work has not received the attention it deserves. In this article the theory and praxis of Adriano Olivetti are analyzed in order to shed light on two significant issues in the study of philanthropy generally: first, the basic problem of the applicability of the concept in different cultural contexts, and second, a related question about the borderlines between philanthropic, third sector activities and political activities, and how these borders may shift or even disappear under certain conditions of time and place."
666	1993	VOL	04:02	The dependent variable of the independent sector: the definition and measurement of giving and volunteering	"This paper addresses three topics to which researchers should turn their attention in regard to the dependent variable of giving and volunteering. The first is to develop an expanded definition of philanthropy revolving around the notion of 'gift' and the relations of exchange and around the theological virtue of charity and the emotional dispositions of care, altruism, and love of neighbor. The second is to attend to measurement problems in regard to operationalizing giving and volunteering; obtaining comparable information from givers and non-givers; improving the reliability of the data, including an effort to reduce the amount of missing data; and establishing a consistent unit of analysis. The third direction is to conduct some innovative research activity to obtain better measures and understandings of giving and volunteering, including development of a diary study, closer analysis of the relationship between class and giving, and attention to measuring the social effects or outcomes of philanthropic activity."
667	1993	VOL	04:02	"A revised methodology for estimating total personal giving in the United States, with preliminary estimates for the period 1984 1992"	"This article describes a revised methodology for estimating the current amount of total personal giving in the United States. The previous methodology is evaluated and it is determined that a different methodology, drawing upon recent enrichments in the data on personal giving, would yield improved historical estimates. This would lead to more reliable extrapolations of the current level of giving. Preliminary historical estimates using the new methodology are made for the period 1984 through 1991. These serve as the base for extrapolations to 1992, and results using several extrapolation formulas are compared."
668	1993	VOL	04:03	"Variations in trusteeship: cases from Boston and Cleveland, 1925 1985"	"Case studies suggest that important changes in the composition and structure of boards of trustees of non-profit organizations have occurred in recent decades. The nature of these changes, and how they may vary across industry and locale, are not well documented. This pilot study compares changes in structure and board membership of three elite non-profit organizations in two cities at three points in time: 1925, 1955 and 1985. This study focuses on governing boards of the major art museum, largest non-profit hospital and local United Way of Boston and Cleveland. Board members biographical data are used to assess models of board diversification based on environmental pressures and changes in local elites. We find evidence that trusteeship varies historically, regionally and across industries, and we set the stage for broader-based empirical comparative work on changes in non-profit boards of trustees."
669	1993	VOL	04:03	The history of non-profit organizations in Australia as a test of some recent non-profit theory	"Over the past two decades, a number of important theories of non-profit activity have been developed, mainly by economists. In part, these theories attempt to explain why non-profit organizations are formed and flourish in some fields of activity and not in others. This paper seeks to test the adequacy of these explanations by seeing if they can explain seven cases of the formation of important sets of non-profit organizations in Australia. To this end, it sketches a history of non-profit organizations in Australia over the past 200 years and explores in more detail seven important cases of non-profit formation and development. It finds that, while in most cases the economic theories provide part of an explanation, there is a good deal which they cannot explain. Adequate explanations of non-profit formation will need to draw on social as well as economic theory."
670	1993	VOL	04:03	Non-governmental organizations in international development: trends and future research priorities	"North Atlantic NGOs have significantly increased their role in international development. They have expanded their activities beyond relief to include a more structural approach to third-world poverty and have attracted increasing amounts of government subsidies for their work overseas. They have also begun to engage in education of their home populations about global poverty and have established close ties to an emerging network of third-world NGOs who channel their resources to the grassroots poor abroad. In the post-Cold War era, North Atlantic NGOs enjoy some unique opportunities to expand their work due to the increase of third-world democracy and free-market economies, but they also face some critical challenges ahead  balancing periodic relief efforts with long-term development programs, resisting pressures by governments to use NGOs for their own purposes, upgrading the quality of development education at home, and finding ways to relate to third-world NGOs as more equal partners. These and other challenges (for example, improving institutional capacities of North Atlantic NGOs to handle increasing demands, and relationship between third-world NGOs and grassroots organizations) need the attention of scholars in the years ahead."
671	1993	VOL	04:03	Planning and management of community financing: a review of NGO approaches in the health sector	"In the face of severe resource shortages, community financing is increasingly being promoted as an alternative source of finance for public health providers. Non-government organizations have long-standing experience of community financing, but there is little documentation of the range of approaches. In this review, a sample of twenty NGOs was studied to explore these experiences. The range of approaches adopted by different organizations and the information available regarding success in achieving financial sustainability are described. Two preconditions for successful community financing (in this sense) are suggested by the evidence: collection of relevant background data relating to the proposed site of the community financing program, and consultation with the community."
672	1993	VOL	04:03	Value added taxation and the third sector	"During the last decades, value added taxation (VAT) has become widely used. Introducing or widening VAT may have important consequences for third sector organizations. There is no consistent, widely-accepted theory regarding the treatment of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) under VAT. International comparisons are difficult to make. The general scope of VAT, what goods and especially what services are included in the tax base, may be more important to NGOs than the direct concessions granted them. To comprehend how VAT may affect NGOs, it is necessary to understand the general mechanism and some of the technical details of VAT, such as registration thresholds and accounting requirements. There is a tendency for the legislature to widen the tax base and make VAT as general as possible. Tax administrative considerations may acquire the character of absolute principles. When VAT is introduced or widened, it may be important for NGOs to demonstrate how their tax bill has been changed as a possible unintended side-effect due to the administrative need to make VAT as comprehensive as possible."
673	1994	VOL	04:04	The non-profit sector in a national accounts framework	"This paper first reviews the measurement and presentation of non-profit institutions in the US national income and product accounts. For the most part in these accounts, transactions of non-profit institutions serving individuals are consolidated with those of the individuals served and recorded in the personal income and outlay account, a treatment that a majority of users have never found satisfactory. The paper next details the recommendations for these institutions proposed for the 1993 System of National Accounts (SNA). The paper then offers some suggestions on how the treatment of non-profit institutions in the US national income and product accounts might be modified in the light of the 1993 SNA recommendations."
674	1994	VOL	04:04	Non-profit institutions in an input-output framework	"This paper discusses the conceptual treatment of non-profit institutions in the US input-output (I-O) accounts prepared by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, describes the sources and methods used to identify and measure the output of non-profits by I-O industry, and analyses the published benchmark I-O data for 1982 identifying output attributable to non-profits. In the context of the I-O framework, which is detailed and comprehensive, some conceptual and statistical questions associated with the treatment of non-profits are identified and discussed. These issues of definition, scope and measurement are particularly pertinent in light of the recommendations in the 1993 international System of National Accounts on sectoring and on presentation of flows."
675	1994	VOL	04:04	Non-profit institutions in the United Nations System of National Accounts: country applications of SNA guidelines	"Based on a description of how non-profit institutions are defined in the System of National Accounts, this paper examines the actual treatment of non-profit institutions in several countries, and comes up with an overall assessment in terms of coverage and data quality. Finding both data coverage and quality poor across countries, we make two recommendations aimed at improving the presentation and understanding of non-profit institutions within the SNA. First, we suggest the introduction of a system by which non-profit institutions can be identified within the system of national accounts even if they are allocated to other sectors of the economy. Second, we recommend a wider use of satellite accounts in industries where non-profit institutions are prominent."
676	1994	VOL	04:04	Non-profit institutions in a flow of funds framework	"The benefits of providing a separate accounting for non-profit organizations in the financial accounts of the United States are discussed. At present, national economic accounts in the US include non-profit organizations with individuals in the household sector, separate information on the financial activity of non-profit institutions until now has not been available. In this paper, aggregate statistics from federal government tax-exempt filings for non-profit institutions are put into a US flow-of-funds framework. The data for the 1982 1988 period indicate that non-profit institutions accounted for a significant and growing proportion of assets of the household sector in the United States. Their liabilities were also a surprisingly large share of the household sector total. Moreover, funds supplied by the non-profit sector for investment were in some years comparable to funds made available by several important groups of non-depository financial intermediaries. Separate accounting for non-profit organizations within national economic accounts would be likely to reveal an important channel for investment financing in the United States and would significantly improve our ability to measure and analyze the financial activity of individuals by allowing for a 'purer' household sector."
677	1994	VOL	04:04	Measuring the US non-profit sector: a progress report	"The input-output model currently used for estimating the size, scope and dimensions of the non-profit sector in the US economy is based on the SIC system. Unfortunately, this system is inadequate to provide detailed information on the non-profit sector. In response, we developed a classification system  the National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE)  to define and measure the sector more accurately. This article describes the relationship between the SIC-based measures and the NTEE based measures, and reports on current efforts to link the NTEE system with tax data bases maintained at the Internal Revenue Service."
678	1994	VOL	04:04	Tax-based research and data on non-profit organizations	"Tax-exempt, non-profit organizations represent a significant and growing sector within the US economy. Between 1975 and 1990, assets of tax-exempt organizations increased in real terms by over 150 per cent while the revenue increased by over 227 per cent. This compares to a growth in real GDP of 52 per cent over the same period. A variety of tax policy issues on tax-exempt organizations and the non-profit sector can be addressed using several sources of data collected by the IRS from federal information and tax returns of exempt organizations. The Statistics of Income (SOI) Division, using sample data, conducts studies of many of the different components of the tax-exempt sector, including non-profit charitable organizations, organizations exempt under sections 501(c)(4)-(c)(9), private foundations and 4947(a) charitable trusts, and the unrelated business income of tax-exempt organizations. Income statement, balance sheet and other financial data, as well as a great amount of non-financial information, are collected in these SOI studies. The primary purposes of this article are: first, to document the role of the non-profit sector in the US economy and the evolving growth and change within the sector from the mid-1970s through to the present, and, second, to describe the ongoing SOI studies of tax-exempt organizations, the products and services available through SOI, and the future statistical plans at SOI for data collection and analysis of tax-exempt organizations and the non-profit sector."
679	1994	VOL	04:04	Census data on non-profit organizations	"This paper describes how the Bureau of the Census collects and publishes data on non-profit organizations in its economic censuses program. The paper provides a brief history of the economic censuses and describes in more detail the census of service industries component. The progressive expansion of the industry coverage of the census is explained and related to the non-profit sector. The paper further describes concepts and methodologies that are used in collecting and publishing data for non-profit organizations. Definitions, methods of enumeration, and basic data measures are explained and contrasted to concepts used in covering the 'for-profit' sector. Finally, the paper describes how census data can be used to better understand the non-profit sector and identifies some possibilities for improving information from the economic censuses and other statistical programs which cover non-profit organizations."
680	1994	VOL	05:01	The sound of one hand clapping: the case for and against anonymous giving	"The paper draws on intensive interviews with 130 millionaires to explore the case for and against anonymous giving, to indicate a number of key findings about anonymous giving among the wealthy, and to describe the potential of anonymous giving to raise both the level of care and control in philanthropic relationships. The first two sections of the paper set out the case for and against anonymous giving, emphasizing the instrumental and moral rationale by which the wealthy frame both sides of the issue. The third section discusses the tendencies inherent in anonymous giving toward enhancing moral stewardship and manipulation. In the conclusion, I discuss some conceptual distinctions derived from the analysis and speculate about the value of encouraging the non-wealthy to consider at least some measure of anonymous giving."
681	1994	VOL	05:01	Constraining campaigning: the legal treatment of non-profit policy advocacy across 24 countries	"This paper presents a comparative analysis of the findings of a 24 country study of the legal restrictions on the freedom of non-profit and charitable organizations to engage in public policy campaigning. The countries are divided into those which organize the legal status of non-profit bodies around the concept of a charity, and those that do not. The central finding is that all and only charity law countries have constraints on campaigning which are specific to non-profit bodies. The paper reviews a number of possible explanations for this, at the level of jurisprudential rationales which might show that it is necessary or at least rational for only the charity law countries to have developed such restrictions. To varying degrees, all are found wanting. It is suggested that no explanation based on an 'inner logic of the law' will serve to explain the phenomenon, and that future research might concentrate on comparative political history rather than on jurisprudence."
682	1994	VOL	05:01	Competing for tots: operating objectives and characteristics of for-profit and not-for-profit child care centers in the Pacific Northwest	"Child care services are provided by profit-oriented businesses, not-for-profit agencies and governmental units. This paper compares goal priorities and operating characteristics of not-for-profit and for-profit child care centers in parts of Canada and the United States. Directors of 292 Pacific Northwest centers responded to a survey about their financial and non-financial operating objectives. Results suggest that centers operating under both auspices are capable of altruistic behavior. Differences in motivation between organizational forms were very small. However, variations in operating characteristics and services suggest that the objectives are achieved in dissimilar ways."
683	1994	VOL	05:01	A cross-national study of a method for researching non-profit organizational effectiveness	"Are there criteria that define non-profit organization effectiveness? If the criteria can be identified, is it possible to use them in a comparative study to assess whether and in what way the use of the criteria may vary between nations? This study addresses both questions. The study uses the factorial survey method and is based on the social constructionist conception that effectiveness is created as an ongoing and sometimes contested outcome of a social judgment process. We illustrate the method with samples from the US and UK and compare the results. The results establish the value of the factorial survey method. Analyses show that both US and UK respondents use percentage expenditures on fund-raising, advocacy emphasis, change in financial surplus and unit cost of services as effectiveness criteria. There is evidence that voluntarism is a more important criterion in the US and that advocacy is more important in the UK."
684	1994	VOL	05:02	Transnational social movement organizations in the global political arena	"The post-Cold War period has been a time of rapid change in the international system. One major shift is a dramatic increase in the demands placed upon the United Nations. This increased reliance on the UN suggests that there may be a shift in opportunities for this and other international institutions to have a greater effect on the dynamics of global politics than was possible under the bi-polar system of the past. What are the implications of these changes for nongovernmental actors in the global system? We focus on a subset of international non-governmental organizations called transnational social movement organizations (TSMOs), and begin to document their forms and activities in the global arena. In what ways are TSMOs similar to or different from national social movement organizations, and how do TSMOs organize to engage in transnational political efforts? How do TSMOs interact with international institutions? Our analysis consists of detailed, systematic comparisons among seven TSMOs in the human rights, environmental, peace and development issue arenas, including: Amnesty International, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, International Fellowship of Reconciliation, Oxfam, Peace Brigades International and War Resisters International. We examine five dimensions of variation: founding and mission, leadership structure, membership, resources, and tactics. This work builds on the earlier work of Dennis Young (1992) and helps to inform future research in this area."
685	1994	VOL	05:02	"Changing partners: Northern NGOs, Northern governments"	"Northern NGOs live with an increasing level of insecurity and change. Governmental pressures to professionalize contribute to bureaucratization, while inadequate overheads, an outdated project approach and lengthy approval procedures work against professionalism. Although they spend tens of millions of dollars annually through NGOs, few OECD governments have taken evaluation seriously. Northern NGO survival, therefore, has been largely de-linked from performance. More fundamental is the growing identity crisis that Northern NGOs have in relation to their increasingly crisis that Northern NGOs have in relation to their increasingly effective Southern counterparts. Recession and faltering public support have pushed governments into reduced aid budgets and new concepts of accountability, participation and the role of 'civil society'. Adding to the burden these shifts place on NGOs, many governments now deal directly with Southern NGOs. Many governments have also restricted their matching or 'responsive' NGO funding programs, while providing massive funding increases  on highly favorable terms  for emergency and refugee work. Most OECD governments have also initiated special funds for AIDS, women, democracy and special geographical trouble spots, channeling NGOs towards governmental priorities. Some basic principles are proposed for remedying the problems and for treating NGOs as important elements of civil society rather than as delivery mechanisms for governments."
686	1994	VOL	05:02	How philanthropy can alter our view of the past: a look at Colonial Williamsburg	"The restoration of Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia, serves as an important study in the history of philanthropy in the United States. Williamsburg demonstrates how the investments of philanthropists such as the Rockefeller family can be used to subtly alter Americans perceptions of their past. This manipulation resulted in the promotion of the Rockefellers ideological interpretation of history at Williamsburg. This history stressed the role of Williamsburg as a monument to the ideals of Americanism: democracy, republicanism and individual achievement. Through times of domestic and international crisis, from the Red Scare of the 1920s through the Cold War of the 1950s, the Rockefeller family held up Williamsburg as a beacon to which Americans could look as a steadying force. In doing so, the Rockefellers created a past which never truly existed. They downplayed the roles of women and blacks, who were all but ignored in the early presentation of the town, in favor of the aristocrats of the age: George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and George Wythe. The presentation which emerged during the restoration's first half-century was one that failed to acknowledge the roles played by less prominent groups and over-accentuated the importance of a small minority of illustrious townspeople."

"Employment patterns in various sectors of retailing have received much research attention in recent years, and investigation into charity volunteering is prolific. There is, however, little academic research to date into employment issues in charity retailing or reference to the volunteers who work in charity shops. This has been a neglected topic, left in the hands of those with particular charity interests rather than an academic topic in its own right. This paper looks at the profile of the charity shop volunteer and raises the issues of future changes in technology and competition which might have an impact on current volunteers."
688	1994	VOL	05:02	On the socio-economics of voluntary organizations	"This article discusses two aspects of the interconnected social and economic features of voluntary associations. First, it characterizes the transformation processes of voluntary associations which make them more similar to bureaucratic business organizations. The article's second endeavor is to discuss how changes in the economic features of an association have an impact on its social elements. The key argument is that changes in economic features of a voluntary association have important negative effects on its social basis. The analysis focuses on how changes in the mode of financing of an association affect the solidarity of its members."
689	1994	VOL	05:03	The third sector in welfare policies in Italy: the contradictions of a protected market	"The paper describes how the involvement of non-profit organizations (NPOs) in welfare politics in Italy has historically developed in a mutual accommodation with the state, which has prevented the growth and the public recognition of an independent third sector. Using data from official statistics and recent research on non-profits, three analytical dimensions of the relationship between State and the third sector are considered: the resource exchange, the division of responsibility for delivering public services, and the dynamics of social policy making. The study indicates that distinctive features of the 'welfare mix' in Italy have been: the attribution of public status to many NPOs as a consequence of an arrangement between Church and state, the weakness of state guidance, in spite of the generous economic assistance provided to NPOs by the state, the substitutive role of NPOs in providing basic public services, and the emergence of informal arrangements between public authorities and NPOs mediated by political patronage."
690	1994	VOL	05:03	Revenue diversification among non-profits	"Although the non-profit literature has grown substantially, the issue of how revenue diversification affects non-profits has not been fully explored. This paper presents several disciplinary perspectives regarding the financing of non-profits, what determines their ability to diversify, and the consequent effects on their behavior. It first develops an index for measuring revenue diversification and applies it to a national sample of charitable non-profits. The results indicate that, while the perception that most non-profits rely on a single revenue source is exaggerated, the institutions in our sample have somewhat concentrated revenue. Our findings also suggest that the activity of a non-profit and the proportion of its expenditures that it devotes to fund-raising affect its ability to diversify its revenues concentration. While a number of anomalies exist, the weight of our evidence suggests that diversified revenue sources are more likely to be associated with a strong financial position than are concentrated revenue sources. Researchers interested in studying the life-cycle of non-profits, the factors that give rise to stability and growth, and the constraints on non-profit behavior would do well to consider the diversification index presented in this paper."
691	1994	VOL	05:03	Defining contracts between the state and charitable organizations in national accounts: a perspective from the UK	"This paper explores the issues inherent in defining contracts for service delivery between the state and charitable organizations, and in differentiating them from grants. It begins by making the point that there is no one correct definition of a contract, rather, it is a function of its purpose. It then details our work in developing a definition of a contract within the national accounting tradition, as part of a study of the contribution of charitable organizations to the GDP of the United Kingdom. The paper ends by drawing some general conclusions from this experience."
692	1994	VOL	05:03	Using NTEE to classify non-profit organizations: an assessment of human service and regional applications	"The National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE) constitutes a major contribution to the field of non-profit research, but is beset by conceptual and practical problems. The application of the taxonomy to the list of charitable organizations recognized by the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is also an important resource for research, although it has limitations as well, especially for industry-specific and regional analyses. Using survey data from the Chicago metropolitan region, I show that regional estimates for human services based on only those charitable organizations which are required to file tax returns may miss over 40 per cent of the total number of organizations and under-estimate total revenues by almost half. Finally, I point to conceptual, technical and institutional challenges that must be addressed if the NTEE is to gain maximum utility."
693	1994	VOL	05:03	"Making a difference? Student volunteerism, service learning and higher education in the USA"	"This paper reviews evidence concerning the recent growth of volunteerism among college students in the USA. It describes the various pressures to expand such activities and outlines steps being taken to promote them. Reforms of student financial aid can be used to facilitate service among students who would otherwise have to engage in substantial paid work to afford education, while educational institutions are taking numerous steps, most notably through integrating community service and academic study, to promote such involvement. The more general issues raised by all this are: the likely impacts on servers and served of this activity, whether education-based community service has demonstrable educational benefits, its impact on higher education institutions, and the wider impacts in terms of political attitudes and behavior."
694	1995	VOL	06:01	The proposed European Association: a symbol in need of friends?	"The 1991 proposal on a European Association (EA) was revised in 1993. It has not yet been adopted. The UK and Germany appear to be negative, while France and Spain, who are holding the presidencies of the European Union in 1995, supposedly are more positive. Nobody knows if and when the European Association regulation will be adopted. On many points the proposal is flawed, too bureaucratic and detailed. Too much attention is paid to the internal procedures of the Association, and too little to the possibilities for tax evasion and the exploitation of lax regulatory environments for non-profit organizations (NPOs) in some member countries. The EA regulation matters most to small and medium NPOs. For these organizations the costs of establishing themselves in other jurisdictions and complying with foreign laws might be disproportionately high. For the truly big NPOs the costs may be more marginal. Despite all its faults, not adopting the proposed European Association statute will be another lost opportunity in the modern saga of NPOs."

Like those nations too, Bulgaria faces a number of challenges in its pursuit of forming a strong non-profit sector. Chief among those challenges are establishing a sound legal foundation, defining the social purposes and functions of the non-profit sector, and establishing the legitimacy of these organizations in the minds of the Bulgarian people. These three challenges are analyzed in the essay, following an overview of the current make-up and characteristics of the emerging non-profit sector."

It explores the reasons for and the significance of the differences between the two estimates. Conclusions are drawn on the relative merits and demerits of the two survey datasets, and the circumstances in which it might be appropriate to use each of them."

Comparison of two of these projects reveals significant differences in approach and effectiveness. American businesses supported a secondary school, Pace, which experienced critical problems related to organizational difficulties unforeseen by the donors. South African business supported an educational center, the Funda Centre, which developed more gradually and was more deeply rooted in the community. Examination of these two cases produces some lessons that can be of use to other donors giving support to local development initiatives."
698	1995	VOL	06:02	Communicating philanthropy: The media and the voluntary sector in Britain	"Whether in looking for resources or doing their work, voluntary and charitable organizations have always needed to publicize their existence. However, major changes in the role and funding of the sector in Britain have meant that the issue of publicity has gained particular salience. This article discusses these changes and provides preliminary findings from a large-scale investigation into media and public attitudes towards voluntary and charitable activity. It explores how voluntary activity is reported by mainstream news media, and how these presentations are framed by media professional's perceptions of, and value judgments about, different types of voluntary action."
699	1995	VOL	06:02	Buddhist commons and the question of a third sector in Asia	"Very little attention has been devoted by third sector researchers to the question of comparable or related activities in Asia. This article explores a complex of Asian Buddhist religious beliefs and practices using 'the commons' as a comparative concept. Examination of published, English-language sources provides clear evidence of the existence of a variety of third sector-like activity in Asia far in the past. Village codes codifying charitable practices and village associations have been recorded in China, Japan and Korea. In addition, a good deal of charitable and philanthropic activity has been associated with Asian Buddhism: beliefs supporting gift exchange (dharma anddana), veneration of certain leader-philanthropists, a distinctive model of community organization (sangha), a Japanese model of fund-raising (kanjin) campaigns, and a long tradition of international Buddhist convocations are among the range of indigenous common goods which can be found in the Asian context prior to any discernible western influences."
700	1995	VOL	06:02	Part of the welfare mix: The third sector as an intermediate area	"This article presents a conceptional framework which analyses the third sector as a part of a mixed welfare system, otherwise made up of the market, the state and the informal private household spheres. From this perspective, the third sector appears as a dimension of the public space in civil societies: an intermediate area rather than a clear-cut sector. Third sector organizations are understood as polyvalent organizations whose social and political roles can be as important as their economic ones, they are portrayed as hybrids, intermeshing resources and rationales from different sectors. In present policies of 'welfare pluralism' the emphasis is consequently more on 'synergetic' mixes of resources and rationales than on mere issues of substitution processes between different sectors of provision. The last section discusses the potential distinguishing features of such policies with respect to 'pluralist' approaches which try to safeguard the conventional hierarchies in a mixed economy of welfare."
701	1995	VOL	06:02	Politics and the development of the Hungarian non-profit sector	"One of the important developments in post-Communist Hungary has been the growth of the voluntary or non-profit sector. Under the Communist regime, voluntary associations were controlled and independent organizations were largely suppressed. During the 1980s, advocacy groups and independent associations emerged to challenge the Communist monopoly on organization. These challenges were instrumental in laying the foundation for the post-Communist non-profit sector, providing models of organization and experienced activists. After the creation of a new legal framework in 1989 and 1990, the growth of the non-profit sector was dramatic. Two types of non-profit organizations have developed in democratic Hungary: associations predominate in membership activities, while foundations are active in fields requiring fund-raising. Attempts by the Hungarian Democratic Forum-led government to shape the non-profit sector to meet its goals were met with political pressure from professionals in the non-profit sector. The result was the beginnings of a contract-for-service regime and increased organization of a contract-for-service regime and increased organization of interests within the non-profit sector itself."
702	1995	VOL	06:02	Explaining the curve in the U-shaped curve	"In a previous paper we have demonstrated that for the total population of households, including non-givers, lower income households participate less and donate smaller average percentages of their household incomes than do higher income households. In this paper we inquire about the relative generosity of that sub-population of households that actually donate to charitable causes. We base our analysis on data collected in the 1990 national survey of Giving and Volunteering in the United States conducted by the Gallup Organization for Independent Sector. In the first section we review the factors that differentiate the upward sloping curve describing the population of all households and the U-shaped curve describing the sub-population of contributing households. In the second section we demonstrate that a substantial proportion of the curvature in the U-shaped relationship operates through giving to religion. In the third section we show that giving by the 7 per cent of high givers increases the curvature while the giving by the 93 per cent of normal givers attenuates the curvature. In the fourth section we combine the previous two analyses by looking at the patterns of religious and non-religious giving for both normal and high givers. We conclude that income is not a reliable indicator of who is generous or selfish in regard to philanthropic giving."
703	1995	VOL	06:03	The third sector in welfare policies in Italy: the contradictions of a protected market	"The paper describes how the involvement of non-profit organizations (NPOs) in welfare politics in Italy has historically developed in a mutual accommodation with the state, which has prevented the growth and the public recognition of an independent third sector. Using data from official statistics and recent research on non-profits, three analytical dimensions of the relationship between State and the third sector are considered: the resource exchange, the division of responsibility for delivering public services, and the dynamics of social policy making. The study indicates that distinctive features of the 'welfare mix' in Italy have been: the attribution of public status to many NPOs as a consequence of an arrangement between Church and state, the weakness of state guidance, in spite of the generous economic assistance provided to NPOs by the state, the substitutive role of NPOs in providing basic public services, and the emergence of informal arrangements between public authorities and NPOs mediated by political patronage."
704	1995	VOL	06:03	Revenue diversification among non-profits	"Although the non-profit literature has grown substantially, the issue of how revenue diversification affects non-profits has not been fully explored. This paper presents several disciplinary perspectives regarding the financing of non-profits, what determines their ability to diversify, and the consequent effects on their behavior. It first develops an index for measuring revenue diversification and applies it to a national sample of charitable non-profits. The results indicate that, while the perception that most non-profits rely on a single revenue source is exaggerated, the institutions in our sample have somewhat concentrated revenue. Our findings also suggest that the activity of a non-profit and the proportion of its expenditures that it devotes to fund-raising affect its ability to diversify its revenues concentration. While a number of anomalies exist, the weight of our evidence suggests that diversified revenue sources are more likely to be associated with a strong financial position than are concentrated revenue sources. Researchers interested in studying the life-cycle of non-profits, the factors that give rise to stability and growth, and the constraints on non-profit behavior would do well to consider the diversification index presented in this paper."
705	1995	VOL	06:03	Defining contracts between the state and charitable organizations in national accounts: a perspective from the UK	"This paper explores the issues inherent in defining contracts for service delivery between the state and charitable organizations, and in differentiating them from grants. It begins by making the point that there is no one correct definition of a contract, rather, it is a function of its purpose. It then details our work in developing a definition of a contract within the national accounting tradition, as part of a study of the contribution of charitable organizations to the GDP of the United Kingdom. The paper ends by drawing some general conclusions from this experience."
706	1995	VOL	06:03	Using NTEE to classify non-profit organizations: an assessment of human service and regional applications	"The National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE) constitutes a major contribution to the field of non-profit research, but is beset by conceptual and practical problems. The application of the taxonomy to the list of charitable organizations recognized by the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is also an important resource for research, although it has limitations as well, especially for industry-specific and regional analyses. Using survey data from the Chicago metropolitan region, I show that regional estimates for human services based on only those charitable organizations which are required to file tax returns may miss over 40 per cent of the total number of organizations and under-estimate total revenues by almost half. Finally, I point to conceptual, technical and institutional challenges that must be addressed if the NTEE is to gain maximum utility."
707	1995	VOL	06:03	"Making a difference? Student volunteerism, service learning and higher education in the USA"	"This paper reviews evidence concerning the recent growth of volunteerism among college students in the USA. It describes the various pressures to expand such activities and outlines steps being taken to promote them. Reforms of student financial aid can be used to facilitate service among students who would otherwise have to engage in substantial paid work to afford education, while educational institutions are taking numerous steps, most notably through integrating community service and academic study, to promote such involvement. The more general issues raised by all this are: the likely impacts on servers and served of this activity, whether education-based community service has demonstrable educational benefits, its impact on higher education institutions, and the wider impacts in terms of political attitudes and behavior."
708	1996	VOL	07:01	"The managerial revolution, the institutional infrastructure, and the problem of human capital"	"In Scale and Scope, A.D. Chandler explores the role of management in shaping growth and competitiveness in industrializing nations. Chandler views managers as reacting to technological and economic change rather than initiating it, giving little attention to the extent to which growth of modern management and corporate capacities were tied to the emergence of parallel structures in government and society, and the important national differences in the role of public and private sectors in the process. His failure to offer a broad and encompassing paradigm of organizational growth and change produces a celebration of 'American exceptionalism' and corporate bigness rather than a genuinely comparative analysis."
709	1996	VOL	07:01	On scale and scope and the history of the non-profit sector in the United Kingdom	"This article argues that Alfred Chandler's analysis of the British firm cannot be transposed to the very different context of non-profit organizations in Britain. Both in relation to charitable non-profit organizations and mutual benefit organizations, Chandler's theory of the development of firms does not help explain organizational development. The main thrust of the argument is that the explanation for the smaller size of charitable non-profits in Britain than in America is largely institutional and partly socio-cultural, the explanation does not lie in any failure in Britain to adopt new techniques of management and organization. With mutual benefit non-profits, a rather different account is presented. 'Mutuals' which had a strong fraternal element were relatively more successful in Britain than in America, although there is less difference between the two countries with regard to 'non-fraternal' mutuals. Once again, it is argued that institutional and socio-cultural factors rather than the factors identified by Chandler account for this."
710	1996	VOL	07:01	"Public health or public menace? The Rockefeller Foundation and public health in Mexico, 1920 1950"	"This article explores how the Rockefeller Foundation's hookworm campaigns, sponsorship of local sanitary units and involvement in public health education in Mexico shaped the conceptualization and practice of public health during the decades following the Mexican Revolution. A 1923 hookworm agreement set the terms of the relationship, minimizing the Foundation's financial commitment while maximizing its administrative control. In establishing rural health units, the Foundation adapted to local conditions without compromising scientific public health by ingeniously incorporating midwives while shunning other traditional healers. When President Lazaro Cardenass socialist politics threatened the Rockefeller model of public health in the 1930s, delicate tactics enabled the Foundation to overcome these challenges. For the Mexican government, the overriding goals of modernization and progress required an acceptance of Rockefeller pressure and scientific expertise. The special status granted the Rockefeller foundation, its political, administrative, educational and financial strategies, and its institutional flexibility enabled it to influence profoundly the development of the Mexican public health system."
711	1996	VOL	07:01	The role of non-profit corporate foundations in Korea: Positive and negative perspectives	"There are two opposing views on the role of private foundations, especially the corporate foundations. Korean people seem to think that corporate foundations have been used as a device to transfer the wealth of rich families with favorable tax treatment. Considering the current status and past performance of corporate foundations, the evidence seems to lend support to this negative view at the moment. The corporate foundations have performed within a very limited range of activities and have not made many efforts to develop non-profit activities to meet the expectations of Korean society. The negative view does not imply that corporate foundations have not contributed to Korean society. But the negative view can be regarded as a criticism of the past performance of corporate foundations and the way they have been managed."
712	1996	VOL	07:01	Critical success factors for merger in the UK voluntary sector	"This paper reports on research into mergers in the voluntary sector in the UK from 1988 to 1993. It compares empirically derived critical success factors with success factors derived from previous work on mergers in both the voluntary and private sectors. The study concludes that merger can be an extremely effective strategy for voluntary organizations. For it to be so, it has to be undertaken willingly, with a shared vision between the partners of what the merger will achieve. Cultural differences need to be recognized and handled within a trusting context in which mutual respect is backed by an equitable process. Finally, sensitive handling of individuals caught up in the merger process is essential but something which the voluntary sector ought to be well capable of doing."
713	1996	VOL	07:02	The third sector in Scandinavia	"This article argues that it is possible to identify a particular Scandinavian third sector model. In contrast to what might generally be expected in view of the relatively huge public sectors of Denmark, Norway and Sweden, the third sector in this model is neither small nor insignificant. Its constituent traits are rooted in history, in popular movements and in trust-based mutual dependency between third sector organizations and public authorities. Though challenged by recent developments, this model is still a cornerstone of the Scandinavian welfare state."
714	1996	VOL	07:02	The state and voluntary social work in Sweden	"If Sweden has been considered at all within the voluntary research tradition, it is mainly in terms of providing a state-dominated contrast to countries where the sector is said to flourish. This article questions this rather one-sided picture of Sweden, which seems to rest on weak empirical grounds, especially if the voluntary sector as a whole is analyzed. The main focus of the article is, however, on social services. It is shown that, from a historical perspective, co-operation between the state and the voluntary sector seems to be a distinctive feature of Sweden, even during periods of government take-over of voluntary activities. Today the relations between the voluntary sector and the state appear to be changing to a situation in which associations are taking part in the production of welfare services to a larger extent than heretofore."
715	1996	VOL	07:02	Autonomy or dependency? Relations between non-governmental international aid organizations and government	"This article focuses on the growth and change that the Norwegian non-governmental international aid field has undergone since the Second World War. Questions are raised on the relationships and borders between the organizations involved and the government. What are the reasons for the apparent closeness of government to nongovernmental organizations? A short theoretical discussion is followed by an empirical description of the Norwegian (and Scandinavian) non-governmental 'landscape'. This description is followed by a discussion of government policy towards these organizations in Norway (and also, to a certain extent, the other Scandinavian countries), and in conclusion some questions are raised on their future role."
716	1996	VOL	07:02	Changes in local voluntary associations in Denmark	"This article analyses the changes in the voluntary sector in Denmark at the local level, and compares associations in the 'cultural field' with those in the 'social field'. The analyses, which are primarily based on research conducted in 1993, show that the voluntary sector changed significantly during the 1980s and the 1990s. First, over a third of the associations were established after 1979, and this has resulted in changes in the overall composition of the sector. Traditional value-oriented associations and associations that work for others have declined in relative terms, while narrow-interest associations that work for the members themselves are increasing. Second, the number of associations that are based and operate in a clearly-defined local area has declined. Third, despite professionalization in some types of associations, more people than ever before are engaged in voluntary work in associations. Fourth, while public subsidies to the voluntary associations have increased, this has not changed the fundamental 'political autonomy' of the associations. Fifth, even though there are great differences in the political context of which the 'cultural field' associations and 'social field' associations are part, the associations in the two fields have many common features."
717	1996	VOL	07:02	Voluntary organizations and local government: lessons from a Danish case study	"The purpose of this article is to analyze the changing relationships between local government and voluntary organizations in the decentralized Danish welfare state within the field of social policy. Here major changes in public discourse have brought voluntary organizations more to the forefront in a welfare state model whose distinct public character might be fading. However, little attention has been devoted to potential problems resulting from intensified co-operation. The article explores these issues using evidence from a case study of the links between public authorities and seven voluntary organizations in the city of Aalborg in northern Jutland. This case study raises the question of whether voluntary organizations, as argued in public debate, can generally be regarded as the antithesis of the bureaucratically and paternalistically organized public social services. Rather, they seem to be co-actors, actively constructing new paradigms and practices in social policy, that cannot be captured in conventional dichotomous models. This suggests that the public bureaucracy versus altruistic voluntary organization, or distinctions usually made between professional and volunteer motives, may be of limited use."
718	1996	VOL	07:02	The legal framework and taxation of Scandinavian non-profit organizations	"The Scandinavian countries are part of the same legal tradition. No Scandinavian country has any written statute on non-profit associations. Their association law is flexible, common-sensical and easy to comply with. To obtain subsidies, the associations may have to submit to regulations regarding organizational structures (open membership and one person, one vote). The law on foundations is more formalized, and the foundations are subject to considerably more control and scrutiny. Scandinavian NPOs are usually exempt from income tax, but do not to any great extent benefit from deductibility for donations. They are subject to payroll tax, and usually to value added tax. The Scandinavian taxation policies may make the NPOs economically dependent upon the government, and subject to regulation through 'subsidy law'."
719	1996	VOL	07:03	Membership participation and ideology in large voluntary organizations: The case of the National Trust	"Commonly, voluntary organizations are formally accountable to their memberships, but the rights of members to influence organizational policies are often minimal. Members may be recruited by organizations to provide funding, legitimacy and voluntary help, members may join in order to obtain material benefits, to express support for organizations goals and, in some cases, to influence policy. The disjunction between these two sets of expectations can lead to disputes in large voluntary bodies, especially those whose members hold a wide range of ideological positions. This creates problems for those running the organizations, who both have to account to a variety of other groups and also maintain their public legitimacy. Illustrations of some of these issues are drawn from environmental organizations, particularly the National Trust."
720	1996	VOL	07:03	"Toward an understanding of fundraising, philanthropy and charity in Western Zionism, 1897 1933"	"Although scholarship on the 'third sector' has successfully integrated Jewish history and the contemporary Jewish scene (including the State of Israel) into its overall agenda, the Zionist movement in Western Europe and the United States, before 1933, is largely absent. This is mainly because, almost until the present, spokespersons for the movement have denied that Zionism is a charity. It may seem obvious that Zionism relied on the tradition of Jews giving to charity, yet this fact is barely reflected in the movement's historiography. Zionism's appeals to Western-acculturated Jews show that many characteristics of Jewish philanthropic societies were essential to the life of the movement. This article explores the institutional strategies which drew on the charitable instincts of Zionism's constituents, especially the creation of the Jewish National Fund (1901) and the Palestine Foundation Fund (1921). The prominence of these bodies led to much of the success, as well as the frustrations of the movement, before the Nazi rise to power."
721	1996	VOL	07:03	Show me the way to the next worthy deed: Towards a microstructural theory of volunteering and giving	"Using the data from a survey undertaken in the United States in 1992, this article examines the effects of altruism, self-interest and social ties on motivations to give and volunteer, as well as the effects of volunteering on definitions of life goals. Social ties with non-profit organizations were good predictors of both the value of charitable contributions and the time volunteered for charitable causes. The level of prior philanthropic activism and social connections with philanthropic institutions had an effect on life goals. Altruism and the desire for self-improvement had effects on volunteering, but not on giving. Utilitarian motives (expected career advancement) had no observable effects on volunteering or giving. Based on those findings, a general microstructural model of philanthropic behavior is proposed."
722	1996	VOL	07:03	Grant monitoring by charities: The process of grant-making and evaluation	"This article presents the results of a survey of grant monitoring in 170 UK charities. The monitoring and evaluation process is modeled and the extent to which donors follow this is explored. Although over 70 per cent of donors monitored grants, a much smaller percentage proceeded to evaluate results. Reasons for this and an indication of how the processes are carried out are presented."
723	1996	VOL	07:03	Volunteering in a voluntary community: Kibbutz members and voluntarism	"The way in which kibbutz members define voluntarism, their attitudes toward it, the volunteering they do, their reasons for doing it, and the helping mechanisms and obstacles that the kibbutz offers were explored in a sample of four Israeli kibbutzim. This is a preliminary study of the way a unique society deals with a well-known field. Between-kibbutz differences were found mainly between the religious kibbutz and the others. No satisfactory explanations for between-person differences with regard to volunteering could be found, and it is hypothesized that the difference may lie in orientation to traditional kibbutz ideology."
724	1996	VOL	07:04	Women and philanthropy in Argentina: from the society of beneficence to Eva PerÑn	"This article focuses on the history of voluntary associations in Argentina over the past 200 years. Argentine voluntary associations have their roots in the alliance of the Catholic church, the state and the country's elites, in which women played major roles. The charitable stage can be divided into two phases: the first (1600 1899) was encouraged mainly by the church, in particular through the Sisters of Charity, the second (1820 1940) took shape under state patronage in a period of centralization and secularization. The Society of Beneficence, a quasi-public institution run by wealthy women, emerged as the most important institution for public assistance until the formation of the Eva PerÑn Foundation, which became the paradigmatic form of social assistance in the 1940s. Nevertheless, the approach adopted by the Foundation differed very little from those of its precursors. Within this framework the current social development model attempts to reconfigure the relationships between the public institutions and civil society."
725	1996	VOL	07:04	Women and philanthropy in nineteenth-century Ireland	"Religion played a major role in directing the philanthropy of Irish women in the nineteenth century. The most extensive systems of welfare were provided by Catholic female religious communities, but substantial and extensive charity was also provided by Protestant denominations. There was much rivalry between Catholic and Protestant charity workers, particularly in work relating to orphaned and destitute children. While the denominational basis of charity work prevented women of different religious persuasions from working together as philanthropists, lay Catholic women were profoundly affected by the limits placed on their activities by nuns. Lay Catholic women had no major tradition of organizing in institutions or societies for charity work and, in consequence, the experience of organizing for social change came later to Catholic women than it did to Protestant women. Catholic women were slow not only to join reform organizations but also to campaign for changes in social legislation or to demand suffrage."
726	1996	VOL	07:04	Women's strategies in Dutch philanthropy	"Dutch women have historically been philanthropists, with an emphasis on the giving of time. This article describes several strategies in which Dutch women have used philanthropy in different periods of time and in different social situations to widen their scope of action for themselves. The giving of time was partly related to the burgher ideal of domestic family culture, in which women were not supposed to join the labor force but instead become caring mothers and spick-and-span housewives. Another factor was the relative prosperity of the nation: the income of the male breadwinner was enough to support the whole household. To maintain social contacts and to gain prestige without abrogating social, religious and community norms, married women turned to philanthropic and volunteer organizations, especially in social services, welfare and health care. Many of them found a life-time occupation in volunteering. They created a parallel power structure in the public sphere. More recently, giving of time has become a means of gaining work experience. Volunteering has become an instrument to accomplish women's liberation, by building women's organizations, and interest and self-help groups."
727	1996	VOL	07:04	Women and philanthropy in Germany	"In terms of finances, the state and non-profit organizations in Germany are closely interrelated, philanthropy has until recently played only a minor role. However, with the financial crisis of the German welfare state, philanthropy and fundraising have started to play more important and more visible roles since the early 1990s. Yet most women's organizations so far have neglected to tap or to develop private funding resources to a larger extent. While traditional women's associations still predominantly rely upon volunteerism, autonomous women's projects are heavily dependent upon government money. There is a huge untapped potential for philanthropy in Germany in general, and for women's causes in particular, and several examples show that many women are prepared to support women's causes when they are asked to do so. To foster philanthropy by and for women in the future will mean a strengthening of civil society in Germany."
728	1996	VOL	07:04	Women's voluntarism and philanthropy in pre-revolutionary Russia: building a civil society	"Historically, civil activism was primarily shaped illegally in Russia, through the revolutionary underground under tsarism, and via dissident movement under the Soviet regime. Among legal enterprises, philanthropy maintained an orientation toward gradualist social change and mutual support. Women have played a major role in philanthropy and voluntary activities in Russia. Compared to European and American women, Russian women enjoyed far more extensive property rights which defined different strategies for gaining access to public space. Women's philanthropy made its greatest impact on public policy-making agendas not through maternalistic programs for mothers and children but through education of women and girls, and support of women entering the job market. However, their contribution, especially in its civic aspects, has been undervalued for many reasons, particularly in the interpretation of a powerful ethos of female self-sacrifice peculiar to Russian women as a basic motive of women's voluntarism. This article challenges this interpretation and instead portrays women in philanthropy and voluntary activity as agents of social change."
729	1996	VOL	07:04	Women and philanthropy in India	"Women's philanthropy has deep roots in India. A historical survey shows that despite their generally low socio-economic status, Indian women made significant contributions to social progress even while outside the formal power and profit structure. This article also analyses the role of religion, custom, caste and class, political and social movements, and the legal and political structure in motivating and facilitating as well as in restraining women's philanthropy. It is lack of economic independence and an enabling socio-legal structure that has inhibited social entrepreneurship among women, while sociopolitical movements have encouraged it."
730	1996	VOL	07:04	Women and philanthropy in colonial and post-colonial Australia	"Women in Australia developed a distinctive pattern of philanthropy, adapting inherited traditions to their new situation. The Australian colonies had no Poor Laws, government-funded private philanthropy, to which men gave their money but women gave their time, was the primary means of providing relief. In performing this role, women became increasingly allied to conservative forces and divorced from campaigns for social reform. Alienated from the radical voices which dominated social policy formation in the federated nation, their role was marginalized by a masculinist/egalitarian notion of a welfare state. The current retreat from this ideal has prompted a call for a re-evaluation of philanthropy, but it is too early to see whether this will produce new opportunities for women or perpetuate the older gendered pattern of participation."
731	1997	VOL	08:01	The evolution of Israel's third sector: The role of predominant ideology	"The article presents a case study of the evolution of Israel's third sector. It uses quantitative data on the economic structure of the sector, as well as historical data on the changes it has undergone in the past 80 years or so. This period is subdivided into three eras, each characterized by a different dominant ideology within which third sector organizations develop. The analysis emphasizes the interplay between the dominant ideology and the type of existing third sector organizations in each era, and their functions in society. The changes are illustrated using the examples of two key organizations (the Histadrut-Federation of Labor Unions, and the Jewish Agency) and two minority populations (the Charedi-Ultra-Orthodox and the Arab).Studying the Israeli third sector within the context of its social history provides an opportunity to test some of the theories explaining the evolution and characteristics of that phenomenon. Thus, the article explores the implications and contribution of the Israeli case to international third sector theory."
732	1997	VOL	08:01	Public accountability in non-profit industrial development organizations	"Non-profit industrial development organizations (NIDOs) represent a common but little studied community response to widespread deindustrialization in the United States. These non-profits are organized as chartered not-for-profit corporations, public authorities or agencies of local government. Most receive at least some public funding to promote local industrial development. Thus, a key issue is how accountable NIDOs are to the public they have been created to serve. Data from national surveys of NIDO executive directors in 1984 and 1994, as well as a survey of six case study boards of directors, suggest that public accountability is an increasingly important concern among NIDOs. Public hearings, efforts to diversify the boards in terms of gender and race, and connections to community development corporations and other local organizations are among the ways NIDOs attempt to be accountable to the general public. Although few women or racial minorities serve on NIDO boards, those boards with representation of these groups tend to be more concerned with public accountability. Boards containing public officials tend to be less concerned, presumably because their presence makes the NIDOs more directly accountable as a result of the participation of elected public representatives."
733	1997	VOL	08:02	"Trust, repute and the role of non-profit enterprise"	"This article examines the trust hypothesis: the claim that asymmetric information can explain the existence of non-profit enterprise in certain markets. We argue that this hypothesis, in order to be viable, has to meet three challenges: 'reputational ubiquity', 'incentive compatibility' and 'adulteration'. Drawing on modern agency theory, we conclude that the trust hypothesis stands on shaky ground. It can be sustained only under particular conditions that have been neither carefully described in theory nor subject to empirical assessment. The available evidence, patchy and inadequate as it is, seems to suggests that there are some ownership-related differences in aspects of organizational performance connected with asymmetric information. However, there is little evidence that this relates to trust per se or provides a rationale for the existence of non-profit ownership in these industries. We conclude with a plea for substantial research on consumer expectations and provider motivations."
734	1997	VOL	08:02	"Altruism, ideological entrepreneurs and the non-profit firm"	"Ideology and altruism are central to understanding the non-profit charitable sector. This paper addresses three questions. Why do people make charitable gifts? Why do they usually give to non-profit organizations? When can non-profits run by committed ideologues compete with profit-oriented entrepreneurs in the provision of services? the altruistic motives of individuals and the ideological commitments of entrepreneurs come together to support charitable organizations. The non-profit form provides a weak guarantee that gifts are not being syphoned off as profits. Furthermore, independent non-profits can often better reflect donors desires than public agencies constrained by majoritarian claims, and ideological entrepreneurs can use the non-profit form to reify their beliefs without being accountable to profit-seeking investors. A non-profit organization can only survive, however, if it can attract money and customers. Sometimes its ideological character will facilitate both tasks. Non-ideological customers may, nevertheless, patronize an ideological non-profit if the entrepreneur's commitment helps to guarantee high quality."
735	1997	VOL	08:02	Public good theories of the non-profit sector: Weisbrod revisited	"Burton Weisbrod's 1975 article, Toward a theory of the voluntary non-profit sector in a three-sector economy, models non-profit organizations as suppliers of public goods which are undersupplied by government to heterogeneous populations. This article examines the implications, extensions and empirical tests of the Weisbrod theory. It also examines the theories of pure and impure altruism, the heterogeneity hypothesis, and the various 'publicness' indexes of non-profit output. The commonalities between the public good model and the trustworthiness model of non-profit organizations are also explored."
736	1997	VOL	08:02	Stakeholder theories of the non-profit sector: One cut at the economic literature	"This article examines and organizes the economic literature dealing with non-profit institutions using the concept of 'stakeholders'. In general, the literature identifies conflicts between various groups of stakeholders and then proceeds in two very different directions. The first is supportive of the non-profit sector, suggesting that non-profit organizations resolve those conflicts more effectively than other types of institutions. This provides a positive theory of the non-profit sector, explaining that non-profit institutions evolve when they are more effective in providing a particular good or service than other possible institutional arrangements. The second direction is more critical of the non-profit sector, suggesting that those conflicts will persist in non-profit institutions and will require some kind of resolution, including perhaps government intervention. Of course, a stakeholder approach to non-profit theory focuses on conflict and ignores some other views of the sector."
737	1997	VOL	08:02	Entrepreneurship theories of the non-profit sector	"This article summarizes the main results of entrepreneurship theories of the non-profit sector and discusses the impact they may have on theory development and on the real world non-profit sector. It is pointed out that the entrepreneurship approach advances our knowledge of the non-profit sector, especially by stressing the supply-side aspect and by focusing on the preferences individuals must have in order to engage in non-profit activities. There is empirical evidence consistent with entrepreneurship theories. Yet most observations do not exclusively support entrepreneurship theories but also provide evidence consistent with other economic theories of the non-profit sector. This illustrates that the various economic theories of the non-profit sector are more complements than substitutes. Furthermore, entrepreneurship theories indirectly help to improve the image non-profit organizations have in the real world, therefore they play a prominent role in teaching programs which have been established to train non-profit managers."
738	1997	VOL	08:02	Overall evaluation of economic theories	"This article evaluates economic theories of the non-profit sector by their ability to enlighten our understanding of the scope of inquiry, the determinants of the size and scope of the non-profit sector, and the behavioral responses of donors, volunteers, paid staff and non-profit organizations to changes in their external environment. Adherence to a non-distribution constraint has proven to be a useful way of delimiting economic analysis of non-profit organizations, but more attention should be paid to alternatives. Economists have been less successful at developing usable distinctions between voluntary action and exchange. The size and scope of the sector appear to be determined by entrepreneurial supply factors, donations (which in turn are influenced by tax policy, governmental spending, fund-raising, and the quality and mixture of organizational outputs, commercial or charitable), commercial activities, capital supply, the supply of labor (paid and volunteered), the marketability of outputs, and the distribution of consumer characteristics. Variations of James (1983) model have proven useful to predict the reaction of non-profits to exogenous changes."
739	1997	VOL	08:03	The contribution of non-profit organizations to the management of HIV/AIDS: A comparative study	"This article elaborates a typology of organizational responses during the first decade of AIDS/HIV in a dozen Western European countries. Welfare mixes: that is, the division of task between all producers of welfare (both private and public), and the processes at work in these policies, are analyzed. Three types are identified, presenting unexpected variants in respect to general typologies of Western welfare states. They underline the importance of non-profit actors and also argue that new forms of co-operation between those actors and public ones can lead to renewed management of the main social issues currently facing Western welfare states."
740	1997	VOL	08:03	Social participation and charitable giving: A multivariate analysis	"Despite an abundance of survey data on charitable giving, researchers have not analyzed these data asking the kinds of theoretical questions and employing the kinds of multivariate statistical techniques that would advance our understanding of the social processes leading to charitable behavior. This article reports the authors first findings from their continuing efforts to develop and test such a multivariate causal model of the social, demographic, economic and motivational determinants of individual charitable giving. The first section outlines our identification theory of charitable giving. In the second section we discuss the data and how we operationalize our variables. The third section examines whether there is broad quantitative support for major tenets of the model developed if applied at the household level. In the fourth section we enquire about which factors are most strongly related to giving behavior. We conclude with a discussion about the centrality of communities of participation for inducing charitable giving and about the practical implications for fundraising."

They are typically used as if there were a broad consensus as to their meanings and implications, but, in fact, these three words stand in for a much more complicated set of views and understandings of appropriate directions to take in cultural policy. This article considers the various motivations for each of these interrelated ideas and demonstrates that a precise and nuanced knowledge of policy intent is critical to understanding their implications for policy. Whatever words are used to describe a particular place's cultural policy, if the intent of that policy is concealed, intentionally or unintentionally, in a vocabulary whose implications are neither clearly spelled out nor fully appreciated, it will be impossible to know exactly what is to be done and how it is to be judged."

Philanthropy has begun to grow as well, albeit more slowly. The non-profit and voluntary sector and the state, each face important challenges as development of the sector accelerates. The state has sought both to encourage growth of non-profit, voluntary and philanthropic institutions, but also to control the pace and directions of that growth. Those dual aims are reflected in the state's regulation of the sector since the mid-1980s. This article provides detailed information on the development of the non-profit sector in Vietnam. It examines some common problems many of the new non-profits and voluntary organizations face and discusses the rapidly changing environment for philanthropy in Vietnam. The article also reviews the developing legal environment for non-profits and philanthropy, compares the situation in Vietnam to other countries in transition, and situates the functions of the non-profit sector in Vietnam in the context of the emerging scholarly literature on functions and models of the non-profit sector and government/non-profit relations."
743	1997	VOL	08:03	A profile of the non-profit sector in Romania	"With the revolution of December 1989, citizens of Romania gained the right to form non-profit organizations for the first time in 40 years. Since then, Romania has begun to explore the frontiers of private initiative through the introduction of non-profit, non-governmental organizations as well as profit-making businesses. In this article we review the historical development and legal framework of Romania's emerging non-profit sector. We also provide the first empirical snapshot of that sector by applying the International Classification of Nonprofit Organizations (ICNPO) developed by Salamon and Anheier to 499 organizations identified in the Soros Catalogue of Nongovernmental Organizations in Romania: 1991 92. Finally, we speculate on the future development of the Romanian non-profit sector by considering alternative scenarios involving the relationships between indigenous nonprofits, international NGOs and the Romanian government."

Specifically, the article addresses the differences and communalities these non-profit organizations have across the region. It concludes by emphasizing the huge variety of roles and functions performed by non-profit organizations within and across countries, and their often ambiguous position between the private and public realms."
745	1997	VOL	08:04	NGOs and philanthropy in Latin America: The Brazilian case	"It is only in the last twenty years that there has appeared a field of civil organizations with a significant degree of autonomy from both state and church. But there are trends pointing to changes in the centralizing, authoritarian tradition in government policies towards the non-profit sector in Brazil. This is occurring in parallel with the creation of conditions for change in this sector's negative image in public opinion. While, on the one hand, private social welfare organizations currently appear to public opinion in the worst possible light, being seen to be at the center of the political crisis triggered by revelations of corruption, on the other hand there is a strong climate of moralization and institutional democratization which may favor them in the immediate future. More transparent policies for government collaboration and public control in this area appear to be a major outcome of this process. Questions of the democratization (or deprivatization) of the state, the need for institutional reform, and the constitution of a public sphere have been raised at the center of debates around the role of these civil organizations in Brazil, now and for the future."
746	1997	VOL	08:04	Non-governmental organizations and philanthropy: The Peruvian case	"This article describes the historic evolution of the third sector in Peru, from its emergence during the time the country was under Spanish colonial rule (from 1535 to 1821) until developments in the twentieth century. Using available information, an attempt is then made to appraise the recent and current scope of the topic and the dimensions of the institutions of the third sector. The legal status and tax regimes are discussed. Some organizational forms of survival and solidarity implemented by the grassroots communities are also described. These confer characteristics that may be different from those of other Latin American countries. Finally, relations between the third sector and the state are described."
747	1997	VOL	08:04	Non-governmental organizations and philanthropy: The Colombian case	"There have been three distinct phases in the evolution of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Colombia. The first was dominated by foundations supported by the church and by private benefactors attending to society's welfare needs. In the second, associations created and sponsored by the state assisted in the efforts of small, neighborhood communities, women's groups and labor unions. A final, recent, phase has been dominated by economic development and housing agencies, NGOs involvement in education centers and community development, and research centers concentrating on social issues. At the current time, corporations, associations and foundations are the legal structures through which NGOs are constituted. Beyond providing these legal structures, the 1991 Colombian Constitution recognizes the role of NGOs and establishes that the state has the obligation to support them and to recognize them as legitimate actors in the policy process. Changes currently affecting NGOs in Colombia include their increasingly close links with the state, and difficulties arising from a relative lack of funds from sources promoting international co-operation."
748	1997	VOL	08:04	Non-governmental organizations and philanthropy: The case of Argentina	"The social, cultural and political activities of non-profit organizations in Argentina have a long history. They existed prior to the creation of the nation state. With a very strong religious influence, they expanded throughout the nineteenth century. National state provision of collective goods only started to develop at the end of the nineteenth century as a result of what Salamon (1987) has referred to as 'voluntary failure'. The social, political and economic changes that have taken place in Argentina during the last decade had not only had an impact on non-profit organizations, but also on the traditional roles and responsibilities in the development of the state, the market and civil society. The political democratization which started in 1983, along with the economic stability of the 1990s, were the two most relevant factors to affect non-profit organizations. The new social movements which had emerged during the previous decade (1976 1983) tended to disappear, leaving behind a wide array of organizations concerned with youth, women, human rights and neighborhoods. With a focus on poverty issues, several state agencies now priorities new strategies and mechanisms which involve the participation of civil society in social policies. The extent to which these will develop, how large the resources devoted to these programs will be, and what kinds of controls over NGOs the state will implement are some of the main topics which will demand close attention."
749	1998	VOL	09:01	Civil Society in Comparative Perspective: Involvement in Voluntary Associations in North America and Western Europe	"Involvement in voluntary associations is analyzed from the perspective of questions raised in the debate about civil society. After demarcating the concept of civil society in relation to the community, the market, and the state, expectations are formulated about the negative effects of modernization and individualization on volunteering and the positive effects of volunteering on social capital and public discourse. World Values 1990 data are used for inter- and intranational analyses. Neither rankings of thirteen Western nations nor in-depth analyses of the U.S., the Netherlands, and Italy support worried reflections about the effects of modernization. The Idea that involvement in voluntary associations is conducive to social cohesion and political democracy finds empirical support. Both mere membership of an association and actual volunteering within such an association appear to be important in this respect."
750	1998	VOL	09:01	Building Local Democracy: The Role of Western Assistance in Poland	"This article argues that foreign assistance, as an external force, has played an important role in shaping the local democracy-building process in Poland. The local context, which is omitted from the transition debate, is considered, and the influence that U.S. public donors exercised at the local scale is highlighted. The article claims that the delayed commitment on the part of these donors to local democracy and to the building of self-governing capacities and participatory practices has undermined the stability and effectiveness of the reforms in Poland. It is shown how this process took place through three different constructs: initial lack of direct assistance, the form under which this assistance was provided, and the donors selectivity of recipients, both in terms of social groups and of geographic areas. It concludes by outlining areas where changes of assistance delivery should be made both by the donors and recipient communities."
751	1998	VOL	09:01	Evaluating Social Service Agencies: Fuzzy Pictures of Organizational Effectiveness	"This article presents a case study of how members of three funding organizations evaluated the same two agencies in Canada. The research on which the article is based sheds light on the organizational effectiveness construct, on the ways in which the evaluators use it to reach conclusions on agency effectiveness, and the relation between these conclusions and funders decisions on agency funding. The authors describe a framework for understanding evaluation processes, describe three funders in terms of this framework, set out predominant patterns in evaluation processes the funders used, and show the effects of these patterns from the agency's perspective. They then discuss the implications of the findings for agency managers and how the findings relate to theories of organization."
752	1998	VOL	09:01	Philanthropy in 18th-Century Central Europe: Evangelical Reform and Commerce	"This article focuses on the close linkage between domestic philanthropy and commerce at the end of the early modern period, and the sophistication with which well-connected evangelical institutions transcended the confines of established religion and territorial boundaries. Use of a large set of primary and secondary sources that are relatively unknown in the history of the voluntary sector permits the examination and analysis of several notable aspects of the Francke Orphanage Foundations, an 18th-century central European institution of evangelical reform and colonial mission. Particular attention is given to the innovative efforts of their founder, August Hermann Francke, to secure an independent financial base for his institutional goals. These goals, which were supported in large part by members of the German nobility and of merchants in the imperial cities, included but were not limited to reform of charity care and education. From the outset, a close network of personal supporters and evangelical institutions that extended throughout Protestant Europe proved essential for both trade and evangelical mission, this network permitted expansion into Russia and the Baltic provinces, Hungary, the Near East and India, and eventually the British North American colonies."
753	1998	VOL	09:02	Unpacking the State: The Implications for the Third Sector of Changing Relationships Between National and Local Government	"The drive to welfare reform has revolutionized the relationship between the state and the third sector in many countries. But this article argues that, if we are to understand the impact of the changing role of the state on the third sector, then we must first understand the dynamics of the relationship between national and local government. It compares two countries the U.K. and Italy where national-local government relations have developed in different directions, and suggests a number of avenues for further analysis of this three-way relationship."
754	1998	VOL	09:02	The Role of the Nonprofit Sector in a Self-Governing Society: A View from the United States	"This article explores the role of private, nonprofit organizations in a self-governing society. A framework identifying the diverse theories that explain the various types of nonprofit organizations observed in contemporary American society is sketched. This provides a fuller understanding of the varied and complex ways that nonprofit organizations contribute to the institutions of governance."
755	1998	VOL	09:02	Foundations and Their Institutional Context: Cross-Evaluating Evidence from Germany and the United States	"According to the relevant literature, the relationship between government and the private foundation sector in Germany is marked by a paradigm of conflict very similar to the one that has often dominated the U.S. discussion of government/nonprofit relationships in the past. More specifically, scholars often hold that the development of foundations in Germany is largely hampered by an administrative and regulatory climate that weakens rather than strengthens the foundation community. Two main arguments are brought forth in this context: First, the expansion of the state bureaucracy into traditional activity fields of foundations crowds out the foundation sector, second, the structure of tax regulations is detrimental to a sound development of foundations. However, while these arguments figure prominently in the policy debate, they have neither empirically nor analytically been substantiated as of yet. Borrowing from organizational theory, this article critically evaluates the arguments in the light of available evidence in an effort to contribute to a better understanding of foundations in an international context."
756	1998	VOL	09:02	"Reassessing Charity Trusteeship in Britain? Toward Conservatism, Not Change"	"The growing prominence given to charity trustees strategy-making roles and responsibilities is encouraging reassessment of the values and purposes of trusteeship in Britain. This occurs against a background of an increasingly professionalized and managerialist charity sector. Trustees are seen, in public policy terms, as a homogeneous and leadership-oriented group, while some charity managers aspire to or are already fulfilling leadership roles. This research note reviews these developments, considering trustees strategy-making and controlling functions, and the nature of the relations between charity staffs and trustees. It describes the development of a tentative typology by the authors, characterizing trustees approaches to their roles, as a means of illustrating the heterogeneous rather than homogeneous nature of the overall charity trustee body. The research process, leading toward the typology's development, is outlined and critiqued. Reflections on the value of the typology are given and possible future developments in trusteeship are considered. The authors consider that those trustees willing to remain in role are likely to adopt custodial rather than entrepreneurial approaches to their trusteeship. Such a role is likely to be increasingly at odds with the role sought or adopted by senior managers in some charities, and also with the proactive model of trusteeship that is being encouraged by the regulatory systems for British charities."
757	1998	VOL	09:03	Whither the Third Sector? A Response to Estelle James	"Nonprofit research and resulting theory have evolved in a limited context of North American and West European historical experience, culture, and political economy. Recognizing this fact, Estelle James proposes, among other things, a widening of the research arena. This response to her proposals argues that existing studies of nonprofits involved in international development already provide significant comparative evidence that can enrich existing theory. This body of work suggests complementary and alternative research priorities."
758	1998	VOL	09:03	Social Origins of Civil Society: Explaining the Nonprofit Sector Cross-Nationally	"Recent research has usefully documented the contribution that nonprofit organizations make to social capital and to the economic and political development it seems to foster. Because of a gross lack of basic comparative data, however, the question of what it is that allows such organizations to develop remains far from settled. This article seeks to remedy this by testing five existing theories of the nonprofit sector against data assembled on eight countries as part of the Johns Hopkins Comparative Nonprofit Sector Project. The five theories are: (a) government failure/market failure theory, (b) supply-side theory, (c) trust theories, (d) welfare state theory, and (e) interdependence theory. The article finds none of these theories adequate to explain the variations among countries in either the size, the composition, or the financing of the nonprofit sector. On this basis it suggests a new theoretical approach to explaining patterns of nonprofit development among countries the social origins approach which focuses on broader social, political, and economic relationships. Using this theory, the article identifies four routes of third-sector development (the liberal, the social democratic, the corporatist, and the statist), each associated with a particular constellation of class relationships and pattern of state-society relations. The article then tests this theory against the eight-country data and finds that it helps make sense of anomalies left unexplained by the prevailing theories."
759	1998	VOL	09:03	A Comment on Salamon and Anheier's Social Origins of Civil Society	"In this paper we examine Salamon and Anheier's characterization and testing of alternative theories of the size and scope of the nonprofit sector in different countries. We identify various nuances and refinements of these theories, and we suggest ways in which their validation through statistical testing can be extended and improved. Finally, we offer additional avenues of research that could productively exploit the important cross-national data set assembled by the Johns Hopkins Project."
760	1998	VOL	09:03	Comments on Social Origins of Civil Society	"Lester Salamon and Helmut Anheier's Social Origins of Civil Society: Explaining the Nonprofit Sector Cross-Nationally offers a thorough cross-national quantitative analysis of the correlates of nonprofit-sector size, composition, and sources of funding. The first study of its kind, it is remarkable in both its theoretical ambition and empirical scope. Still, this research is plagued by problems that affect almost all research of this type: small numbers, poor measures, vague theories, a preponderance of cross-sectional data, and so on. Suggestions for improving the research include: (1) disaggregating the definition of the nonprofit sector to address criticisms from both the right and the left, (2) adopting a multidimensional approach to assessment of the nonprofit sector, to deal with its great heterogeneity, (3) devoting more attention to possible nonlinear relationships, and (4) casting a wider theoretical net in the effort to build a convincing social origins perspective. In the end, Salamon and Anheier may be forced to devote more effort to qualitative analysis of specific sectors to demonstrate the explanatory power of the social origins perspective."
761	1998	VOL	09:03	"On Developing Comparative Nonprofit-Sector Theory: A Reply to Steinberg and Young, and Ragin"	"Responding to comments on Social Origins of Civil Society, an article published in this issue of Voluntas, this article focuses on three critical issues that underlie cross-national theory building and theory testing in the field of nonprofit studies: the issue of definitions, the challenge of operationalizing key theoretical concepts, and the nature of the tests available to verify results. Regarding the first, the article defends the structural-operational definition used in The Johns Hopkins Comparative Nonprofit Sector Project against suggestions by the commentators that it either be expanded or narrowed, arguing that the alternative is either to broaden the focus beyond what is manageable or to make the basic yardstick vulnerable to changing political and policy shifts a sure prescription for confusion. Regarding the question of operationalization, the article concedes that better measures of some key features of prevailing theories might be imaginable, but, since few of these are available, it cautions against letting the best become the enemy of the good in cross-national nonprofit theory testing. Finally, the article finds, in suggestions that multivariate techniques be used in testing various nonprofit theories, confirmation of its central argument that a contextual analysis of the sort embodied in the authors social origins approach is needed to come to terms with the reality of the nonprofit sector cross-nationally. Taken together these comments underline the need to continue the kind of systematic data gathering and theory testing that the authors have undertaken, to utilize an interdisciplinary approach, and to link the study of the nonprofit sector to social analysis more generally."
762	1998	VOL	09:03	Developmental Dynamics in Nonprofit-Sector Federations	"This article explores developmental processes in community-based issue domains and the effects of such processes on the federated referent organizations (FROs) that emerge to address problematic issues. Such organizations mobilize resources and serve as focal points for collective strategies. FROs encounter developmental tensions as they oscillate between adaptation to their environments and construction of new contexts. The way these tensions are resolved suggests three possible response scenarios: reorientation, replacement, or demise. Likely conditions for each scenario are explored. A case study of a federation of over 200 nonprofit organizations in a metropolitan region in the United States is used to illustrate the argument, and implications for similar types of organizations are indicated."
763	1998	VOL	09:04	Organized Environmentalists: Democracy as a Key Value?	"This article, taking as its point of departure that voluntary organizations are of crucial importance in a democracy, views the transformation of the Norwegian voluntary sector through the lenses of what happens within the environmental field. Seeing changes within this field as prototypical for the transformation of the voluntary sector more generally, we start with the organizational level and contrast old versus new environmental organizations. The aim is to ascertain to what extent the newly built organizations are leaving the historically important democratic organizational model. Second, we compare attitudes toward democracy of members of the democratically and nondemocratically built organizations: attitudes both toward democracy within a voluntary organization (internal) and democracy in society (external). Furthermore, we compare these findings with what we find for the population at large. The last section analyzes demographic characteristics of organized environmentalists to see whether a new type of elite, more distanced from the population at large, is emerging in the new and nondemocratically built organizations. The study finds that new organizations are definitely breaking with the democratic organizational model. The support for democracy (internal and external) is comprehensive but not always overwhelming, and there is a tendency in the direction of congruence between organizational structure and individual attitudes. That is, members of democratically built organizations especially value internal but also to some extent external democracy more than members of nondemocratically built organizations. However, even if formal democratic structure and democracy as an absolute and generalized value seems to be under pressure, it does not follow that a new type of elitism is emerging."

It reports the use of a specific methodological tool the Aston measures as an approach to these issues. In addition to the empirical findings reported, this paper argues for these measures as a useful addition to the methodological tool kit of voluntary sector researchers."
765	1998	VOL	09:04	State and Civil Society in the Political Philosophy of Alexis de Tocqueville	"Alexis de Tocqueville discusses extensively the phenomenon of civil society. He distinguishes between the competence of the state on the one hand and the proper competences of free associations on the other. Therefore, the competence of the state should be a limited one. However, since free associations can cause social struggle, the government should also have the ability to limit self-regulation of free associations. Moreover, each government needs a social basis that gives support to this policy of intervention. The central question of this article reads as follows: What method of research is Tocqueville employing to discover this social basis. The conclusion is that his method is to discover what mores form the basis needed by a democratic government to pursue its policy of intervention."

This research note shows that the empirical knowledge of the nonprofit sector is not improved in this change. We first review the treatment of the nonprofit organizations in 1968 SNA, and then discuss the 1993 SNA and 1995 ESA approaches, which do not clear up many conceptual difficulties. The classification of the private nonprofit institutions serving households by the French statistical office is also presented and criticized. A way forward through the use of a satellite account system is proposed."
767	1999	VOL	10:01	The Nonprofit Sector at a Crossroads: The Case of America	"Despite some encouraging trends, America's nonprofit sector stands at a crossroads because of an interrelated series of challenges. Government budget cuts beginning in the early 1980s have eliminated a significant source of nonprofit revenues and created a serious fiscal squeeze for many organizations. Although the sector as a whole managed to replace this lost revenue, it has done so largely through fees and charges that have attracted for-profit businesses into traditional fields of nonprofit action, creating a serious economic challenge to the sector. Simultaneously, important questions have been raised about the effectiveness and accountability of nonprofit organizations, and about what some see as the over-professionalization and bureaucratization of the sector. All of this has undermined public confidence in the sector and prompted questions about the basic legitimacy of the special tax and legal benefits it enjoys. To cope with these challenges, American nonprofits could usefully undergo a process of renewal that revives the sector's basic values, reconnects it to its citizen base, and creates a better public understanding of its functions and role."
768	1999	VOL	10:01	Decentering America's Nonprofit Sector: Reflections on Salamon's Crises Analysis	"Salamon argues that the nonprofit sector is the core or center of civil society. He correctly diagnoses the nonprofit sector's problems but his proposal to hold the center through sectoral renewal and a partnership model of state nonprofit relations is problematic. This is the case in part because the effects of economic globalization are reducing nation-state autonomy. In addition, fragmentation of social identity in a postmodern era challenges sectoral legitimacy, while devolution and localization of social welfare responsibilities reduce nonprofit effectiveness. On the basis of U.S. evidence, I argue that, rather than trying to hold the center, we should decenter the nonprofit sector away from dominant institutions, powerful groups, and privileged places and join the margins in an effort to weave a new, more humane and inclusive social contract."
769	1999	VOL	10:01	Corporatism RevisitedThe Legacy of History and the German Nonprofit Sector	"Salamon argues strongly in favor of a public nonprofit partnership model expressing the European flavor of corporatism. Germany provides a textbook example of corporatist arrangements, particularly in the fields of health care and social services. Whereas American nonprofit organizations are suffering from a crisis of legitimacy caused by marketization, German nonprofit organizations have been confronted with a crisis of legitimacy and identity caused by corporatism since the early 1980s. This particular scenario, however, is not covered by Salmon's analysis."
770	1999	VOL	10:01	Different Eastern European Countries at Different Crossroads	"This paper takes an initial step toward a better understanding of the complex set of pressing problems that need to be addressed by the Eastern European nonprofit sectors and their supporters in the near future. It gives an overview of the main challenges and claims that different nonprofit sectors of the region are at different crossroads. It identifies a general policy crisis that is fueled by the lack of a comprehensive knowledge of the sector and clear political intentions of cooperating with it. In addition, the dependence on foreign funding may result in a sustainability crisis in several Eastern European countries. In the most developed part of the region, the main elements of the present crisis are the fiscal, economic, effectiveness, identity, and legitimacy problems, which have something in common with the challenges facing the much more mature nonprofit sectors of the developed world."

It is argued that, in this situation, the development and growth of the NGO sector though shaped, as in the West, by a set of legislative, political, economic, cultural, and historical forces, nevertheless is circumscribed by the specific conditions of political transformation. The nature of and the power with which legislative, fiscal, or organizational forces condition the development of the sector varies according to the scale at which they operate (local, national, or international). Moreover, it is argued that the position of NGOs is significantly regulated by the state's political ideology, and the formative and evolving character of the latter translates into instability in states actions vis-ö-vis the nonprofit sector."

In the 1990s, with the transition to an African National Congress-led democratic government, these organizations underwent profound changes. This article describes the key dynamics of this process, outlines the challenges currently confronting the new NGO sector, and concludes that the prospects for progressive NGO work in dealing with the poor and marginalized are constrained by the prevailing neoliberal economic climate."

It currently faces a legitimacy challenge in terms of its ability to represent the people, to be accountable to them, and to show its autonomy and difference from the state. It also confronts the challenge of how it can deliver services more effectively as it expands and professionalizes. Raising resources through government, philanthropy, and income generation also continue to be major challenges."
774	1999	VOL	10:01	Civil Organizations in Mexico: Recent Evolution and Prospects	"This paper begins by identifying how, as a result of the confluence of a number of factors, civil organizations (COs) in Mexico have shown an exponential development in the past 15 years. However, it is argued that COs are suffering a fiscal crisis and, in some sense, an economic one, provoked by the political reaction of the government toward this growth. At the same time, there is no crisis of legitimacy, their increasing levels of social support suggests a trend in the reverse direction. However, the legitimacy attributable by the population to nonprofits seems to be due to the novelty of this sociopolitical actor in the context of a disappointment with more traditional ones including government and political parties as opposed to an endorsement of their proven capacity or efficiency in solving the problems of development. To take advantage of what seems to be a golden opportunity for its positive development, in addition to changing the unfavorable economic environment, it is argued that the sector has to face the challenge of thinking in its long-term interest and making sure that it is positioned to act as capably efficient."
775	1999	VOL	10:02	Globalization and the Status of Current Research on the Indian Nonprofit Sector	"An overview of recent trends in research on the Indian nonprofit sector is presented. The material is not exhaustive of all research that has been conducted, but instead discusses effects of globalization on the literature. As used here, globalization implies the worldwide rise of economic liberalism, universal trust in political democracy, the advent of cultural universalism, relative erosion of the power of nation-states, and global embracing of capitalism and commodity culture. The following distinct effects of globalization are discussed: diverse policy debates on nongovernmental organization (NGO) roles in development, challenges to the credibility of India's most popular and debated theory of nonprofits, the emergence of a large volume of literature on environmental and women's movements and organizations, and the shifting of attention to the study of NGOs. A deliberate effort is made to identify the backgrounds of some of the authors discussed in the article to direct attention to differences in content of the writings of NGO officials, activists, scholars, policy analysts, development consultants, Westerners, and Indians."
776	1999	VOL	10:02	The Nonprofit Sector and the Informal Sector: A Theoretical Perspective	"How do and why might different nations demarcate socioeconomic activity into distinct societal sectors? In this review and critique of sector theories, we use the case study of nonprofit sectors compared with informal economies to evidence the difficulty of drawing separate conceptual spaces for economic, human, and social-capital-producing activities. Drawing upon international research on the origins and characteristics of both nonprofit (voluntary, third, independent) and informal (underground, black market) sectors, the conceptualizations of spheres of activity that are alternative to market and state are explored. Hypotheses about the preconditions of different third sectors are generated and a basis for further theorizing about sector interdependence and overlap is provided."

It suggests that the withdrawal of funding should be interpreted in a long-term perspective as a joint responsibility of mutually dependent recipients and funders, rather than simply as the fault of RF decision makers responding reactively to the prevailing climate of McCarthyism. Moreover, it is argued that the conventional wisdom as to the balance of influence within the RF between key staff and trustees is in need of revision. Conceptual implications of these examples of recipient dependence are explored, including the reasons for and dangers of such mutual dependence, the meaning of donor responsibility, and the mediating role of foundation officers."
778	1999	VOL	10:02	Patterns in Household Giving: Evidence From U.K. Data	"he Family Expenditure Survey provides a long time series of household-level data on U.K. charitable giving, which previously has not been exploited. Data analyzed for the period 1978 93 reveal a long-term decline in the proportion of households giving to charity, which persists once we control for changes in other characteristics that affect giving, such as income and wealth. The biggest declines in the number of givers are among younger and poorer households. We also draw out generation-specific trends in a way that is crucial to thinking about future trends in funding for the voluntary sector."

"This article first sets out the principles of neoclassical microeconomic analysis and examines the advances in our understanding of individual giving to charitable organizations achieved within this framework of analysis. It then turns to sociology and considers alternative conceptions of sociological analysis, especially rational-action theories and the qualitative tradition. The contribution of these to our understanding of charitable giving is explored. The article concludes that rational-choice sociology can complement economic analyses in two ways but that qualitative sociology is contradictory to the economic approach."
780	1999	VOL	10:03	Nonprofits and Democratic Development: Lessons from the Czech Republic	"This article argues that existing concepts of the civil society democracy relationship are misleading guides for analyzing political development because they incorporate limited perspectives on the nature and activities of civil society, particularly the nonprofit sector. First, three contemporary conceptualizations of civil society are critiqued, and a contradiction is noted between the importance assigned to ideational functions and the inadequacy of reliance upon elections and party systems. Particular emphasis is placed on civil society's involvement in policy formation, for it is there that a weak state society connection may be discovered, with significant ramifications for democratic development. Second, recent political instability in the Czech Republic is related to negative trends in political attitudes, indicating a weak connection. Third, the general nature of Czech policy-making processes is examined, and then a closer look is taken at the formation of nonprofit legislation and environmental policy. Finally, implications for the future development of Czech democracy are drawn."
781	1999	VOL	10:03	Interest Groups and Social Movements: Self- or Public Interested? Insights from the Brazilian Third-Sector Literature	"By definition, interest groups are seen as self-interested, that is, organizations established to pursue the self-interest of their members. As such, this plethora of self-interested actors has been seen largely as a negative thing, cluttering the policy process, creating unmanageable demands, and leading to iron triangles of interest group/legislative/bureaucratic networks geared toward funneling benefits to narrow groups. In contrast, social movements, nongovernmental organizations, and the like typically are seen as positive, democratizing players in public policy. This paper seeks to muddy both sides of this neat distinction by bringing the Brazilian third-sector literature and field research on scientific and professional associations in the states of Sergipe and Santa Catarina to bear on the question of the self- versus public-interested stance of third-sector groups. On the one hand, social movements can be just as self-interested as the more traditional interest groups. On the other, interest groups often act wholly in the public interest."
782	1999	VOL	10:03	Reviewing the Relationship Between the Voluntary Sector and the State in Britain in the 1990s	"There have been three major analytical reviews that have examined the voluntary statutory relationship during the 1990s, one undertaken by government in 1990 and the other two independently in 1993 and 1996. This article suggests that an historical understanding of this relationship (especially in terms of its sociopolitical dimensions) is crucial, but was missing from the 1990 review and misrepresented by the 1993 review. The 1996 document has been subjected to harsh criticism, but it was arguably sounder in its understanding of this fundamental issue. The national compact between representatives of the voluntary sector and the state, launched at the end of 1998, has built upon the arguments put forward in 1996. However, the paper suggests that given the vexed history of partnership between the sectors and the extent to which the statutory sector has become the dominant partner at the end of the 20th century, it would be premature to be overly optimistic. The paper examines three major shifts in the voluntary statutory relationship during the 20th century, before reviewing the 1990s documents in more detail."

Qualitative content analysis techniques are used to analyze 27 detailed case reports. We analyze the funding patterns and structural attributes of the P/CROs in our sample, with particular attention to how they obtain fiscal resources and membership in spite of the risks they may experience. We then explore the degree of formalization among P/CROs over time and, finally, we examine the ideological frames that P/CROs use and how these frames relate to their tactics. Throughout the analysis we pay attention to how the political context of each region influences P/CRO behavior."
784	1999	VOL	10:04	Groups or Gatherings? Sources of Political Engagement in 19th Century American Cities	"There is broad agreement that citizen participation is critical for successful democracy. Recently, scholars have linked such political participation with the notion of social capital community-level resources, such as trust, norms, and networks, that foster collective action. Much uncertainty remains regarding the sources of social capital, however. Here we examine two different features of community life that are believed to nurture social capital, and political participation in turn: public venues where relative strangers can meet anonymously, socialize, and share information and opinions (i.e., venues for informal interaction), and venues for organized exchange between familiars, such as voluntary organizations and social clubs. Using quantitative data from America's largest cities at the end of the 19th century, we examine the relationship between both supposed sources of social capital and respective rates of voter participation. We find little support for the role of informal interaction in fostering an active and engaged citizenry. We do, however, find evidence that citizen participation was related to some types of associationalism (or organized exchange). In particular, associations that fostered high levels of mutual interdependence among members seemed the most strongly linked to higher levels of political participation."
785	1999	VOL	10:04	Strategy and Structure in Managing Global Associations	"A key aspect of civil society worldwide is the emergence of thousands of nongovernmental organizations that operate on a global scale. The special challenges of organizing and managing these organizations include massive communications problems and the need to accommodate a wide diversity of interests. In this paper, we ask what kinds of organizational structures and management strategies are utilized by globally oriented nongovernmental organizations involved in the development of civil society, and we consider the advantages and disadvantages of alternative structures. From 15 case studies, we find that three principal types of structures are utilized: corporate partnerships, federations, and membership associations. We also find that management challenges are addressed in various creative ways within these structures, and that the federation form appears to be generally effective and avoids some of the risks associated with other forms."
786	1999	VOL	10:04	Social Constructs and Human Service: Managerial Sensemaking of Volunteer Motivation	"Managers of volunteers in human service interpret their job and experiences through a cognitive construct grounded in past interactions and experiences. This construct sensemaking then guides the managers perceptions of subsequent interactions with peers, volunteers, and supervisors. Volunteers similarly make sense of their surroundings through cognitive constructions grounded in their own experiences. Unfortunately, managers and volunteers do not always make sense of their surroundings in the same way. Research has demonstrated that supervisors and paid employees may not necessarily agree in their perceptions of such issues as, for example, employee motivation. Such differences can lead to disagreements about the meaning of behaviors and the design of reward systems, eventually compromising organizational performance. In this study, sensemaking of volunteer motivation was assessed from the manager's perspective and compared with a previous study of volunteers themselves. Differences in understanding such a primary question as why volunteers are present can reasonably be expected to have an impact on organizational effectiveness. Interestingly, the predicted outcome of a different sensemaking schema was not supported in either the understanding of motivation or in the relative importance assigned to altruism. Additional attributes of volunteer managers were also considered to determine if sensemaking is driven by environmental factors such as exposure to volunteers, tenure as a volunteer manager, or social roles associated with gender constructs. These additional attributes were not found to significantly affect the process of attribution of altruistic motives."
787	2000	VOL	11:01	A Third Sector in the Third Millennium?	"Three trends since the 1960s underscore the need for different ways of conceptualizing the new mixed economy in the human services. First, there has been an enormous increase in the number and types of nonprofit organizations, and greater dependence on governmental revenue. Second, extensive growth in privatization and commercialization in the human services. Third, this culminated in the convergence and blurring of sectoral boundaries. Numerous metaphors have been suggested to describe these new patterns, but more suitable concepts and theories are needed. Four theoretical frameworks are analyzed for an intersectoral study of organizations in the same industry: (1) political economy, (2) organizational ecology, (3) neoinstitutionalism, and (4) mixed, open systems. As analytic paradigms, these frameworks could supplement, complement, or be integrated with other research models for third sector studies, and could contribute to theory building and social policy."
788	2000	VOL	11:01	Defining the Nonprofit Sector: Some Lessons from History	"This article seeks to establish whether the structural-operational definition of the sector, used by the Johns Hopkins Comparative Nonprofit Sector Project (JHCNSP), is universal in its applicability. Historical case studies of primary health care and social housing provision in nineteenth-century England demonstrate that the definition cannot accommodate the institutional diversity of earlier periods and does not produce meaningful sectoral distinctions. The structural-operational definition rules out of the sector a significant proportion of nonstatutory, nonprofit maximizing providers. In particular, it excludes the mutual aid organizations, which are widely recognized as important for the development of civil society and which have historically been considered to be key components of the sector. These case studies suggest that the structural-operational definition limits the capacity of the JHCNSP to fulfill its aim of establishing the factors that promote or retard the sector's development owing to potential measurement errors and the pattern of development that the project implicitly assumes for the nonprofit sector."
789	2000	VOL	11:01	Public Perception of Who is a Volunteer: An Examination of the Net-Cost Approach from a Cross-Cultural Perspective	"Our aim is to enhance the knowledge regarding how the public assess and rate volunteerism. We begin by first developing the model for understanding the potential use of the net-cost concept in eliciting the public's subjective perceptions on the extent to which certain activities are perceived as volunteerism. Four hypotheses relevant to the use of the net-cost concept are developed. We developed a questionnaire consisting of 50 case scenarios and applied it in Canada, India, Italy, Netherlands, and Georgia and Philadelphia in the United States, each with a sample of 450 adults or more. With one exception, our net-cost hypotheses are supported, suggesting that the public perception of volunteering is strongly linked with the costs and benefits that accrue to the individual from the volunteering activity, and that this result holds true across different cultures. Finally, we suggest directions for future research that can shed further light on the relationship between net cost and public good."
790	2000	VOL	11:01	Solidarity-Based Third Sector Organizations in the Proximity Services Field: A European Francophone Perspective	"This article reviews the role of third sector organizations in the field of proximity services from a francophone perspective. We analyze how the new wave of initiatives inside the third sector in France and francophone Belgium can be seen as providing institutional responses to state and market failures that arise from trust-dependent and quasi-collective attributes of these services. These initiatives are often called solidarity based third sector organizations, a concept defined in this paper. A central assumption of this analysis is that the political context in which these services are delivered is especially important, particularly as reflected in the changing regulatory role of the state. This analysis takes, therefore, an economic sociology perspective."
791	2000	VOL	11:02	The Uneasy Birth of Czech Civil Society	"This paper analyzes both the political discourse and the reality of Czech civil society. It describes how the concept of civil society has emerged in a difficult ideological context, and sets out how policy towards it has developed, also highlighting its economic role. Recent empirical evidence on the existing range of citizens activities and their attitudes toward aspects of civic society and organizations within it is marshaled in order to estimate the potential for citizenship in the Czech Republic."
792	2000	VOL	11:02	Informality and Nonprofits in East Central European Capitalism	"This paper presents an analysis of nonprofit organizations the organizational infrastructure of civil society in East Central Europe, from one important respect: by placing them in the context of the comparative historical sociology of the region's widespread informality. This involves two steps: (1) summarizing an argument about the role of informality in East Central European capitalism today in order to (2) outline its implications for the study of post-state-socialist nonprofits. Most of the empirical examples come from Hungary. These examples serve illustrative purposes and are intended as devices to provoke new analysis. They are meant to open, rather than close, discussion."
793	2000	VOL	11:02	The Discreet Charm of the Nonprofit Form: Service Professionals and Nonprofit Organizations (Poland 1989-1993)	"This paper examines the role of social proximity (nonprofit) organizations in the process of professional innovation that involved a transfer of human service technologies from Western Europe and the United States to Poland during the 1989 political economic reform. To explain that role, the paper introduces a theoretical model that posits the existence of elective affinity between the social proximity form and occupational interests of service providers. As the existing system of professions is no longer sufficient to legitimate expert services and curb competition among different types of providers, the social proximity form bestows social legitimacy on novel or controversial types of services, and is thus instrumental in marketing those services. The proposed model is supported by quantitative data and in-depth interviews. Theoretical implications are discussed."
794	2000	VOL	11:02	Civil Society Transformed: International Aid to New Political Parties in the Czech Republic and Slovakia	"How do international nonprofit organizations influence political party formation in new democracies? Despite recent analyses of external influences on economic restructuring, less attention has been paid to international assistance to political parties. Contrary to the scholarly literature stressing preexisting socioeconomic cleavages, I argue that new parties may emerge around political cleavages during rapid change, international assistance may encourage new parties to adopt organizational forms and issue areas lacking historical precedent, which are subsequently adapted to mobilize domestic public support. To demonstrate this claim, I contrast assistance by U.S. political party affiliates to parties in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, where similar revolutionary movements emerged in the name of civil society in 1989 but diverged, with a Western market-oriented party in the Czech Republic and populist semi-democratic party in Slovakia winning subsequent elections. The divergent paths highlight the limits to applying Western models of party organization across contexts and the need for democratic actors to be strengthened beyond founding elections."

The paper briefly outlines the development of the third sector in the aforementioned countries, and describes the current state of third sector teaching and research there. It then frames the challenges for the region's teachers and researchers, and proposes an appropriate role for the West, commenting upon the West's relevance within Central and Eastern Europe."
796	2000	VOL	11:03	The Organization of Nonprofit Activities	"This paper investigates the repertoire of organizational forms in Western societies in order to assess the nonprofit sector's distinctiveness. A repertoire of six different ideal type constructs is presented adding to and reformulating existing theories, which have primarily focused on the market and the firm. This new extended theoretical platform builds both on theories discussing market, organization, and governmental failures and on approaches where homo economicus is replaced by homo complexicus and transactions by interactions. This effort aims at making the nonprofit (or voluntary) sector in society both more visible and theoretically substantiated. At the end of this paper, the theoretical framework is applied by analyzing empirical nonprofit organizations."

It still suffers from the experience of 70 years of Communism but is now moving forward with development. This survey reviews the history, evolution, scope, and currency with a focus on the legal underpinnings of the nonprofit sector in Kazakhstan. In addition to discussing the traditions and cultures affecting development, the survey mainly concentrates on the legal and legislative obstacles that discourage rather than encourage more rapid development of the third sector in this Central Asian state."
798	2000	VOL	11:03	Altruism and the Endurance of the Good	"Egoism is a pervasive trait in modern market societies that encourages people to focus upon their own self-interest above all else. Third-sector organizations, by contrast, are frequently termed altruistic. This essay elucidates the meaning of altruism as it applies to these organizations. Moral altruism means direct concern for another's well being whoever that person might be. This study rejects psychological egoism as a meaningful psychological theory, and ethical egoism as a coherent moral position, it discusses empirical studies of altruism in rescuers of Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe as proof against the former form of egoism and Kant's moral theory against the latter. The essay then argues that altruism is a form of public action in Hannah Arendt's sense of this term. The essay concludes that third-sector organizations are altruistic insofar as they engage in public action, thereby, treating beneficiaries with respect for their individuality."
799	2000	VOL	11:03	Social Origins and Transformations: The Changing Role of English Housing Associations	"Following the suggestion of Ragin (1998, Voluntas, 9(3), 261 270), this article uses social origins theory (Salamon and Anheier, 1998, Voluntas, 9(3), 213 248) as an heuristic device to explore change in a specific field of nonprofit activity, the English housing association sector. Conventional histories of the sector in the twentieth century suggest a succession of eras with different policy drivers. These eras can be seen as consistent with shifts in welfare regime from liberal to social democratic (after 1919) and to neo-liberal/neo-corporatist (after 1980). Examples drawn from a panel study support the analysis of Esping-Anderson (1990, The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism, Princeton University Press, Princeton) that underlying the apparent stability of welfare regimes there are constant processes of negotiation and conflict which may lead to transformations at organization, sector, or regime level. Rather than simply responding to policy drivers, some housing associations have been able to influence the environment in which policy is made and thereby to shape their own and the sector's transformations."

To survive and prosper, they have to be increasingly entrepreneurial and business-like and have to actively seek contracts from government and the international donor community. In this context, this paper discusses the diversification strategies of four think tanks identified to be particularly entrepreneurial in developing new lines of work. This includes commercial activities similar to those of consulting firms, and tapping the business community for donations by offering seminars or other products. The paper reviews how these institutions identified and assessed various opportunities, and how they promoted a new line of work. It also explores the rewards financial and other and the challenges that are created by the new types of work within the organizations."
801	2000	VOL	11:04	Gender and Networks in a Local Voluntary-Sector Elite	"Focusing on gender inequality in a local community elite, we investigate the role of gender in access to and participation in networks of nonprofit trustees in Louisville, Kentucky. We examine two types of network relations: participation in the network of overlapping board memberships (the structural network) and interpersonal ties of collegiality and friendship (the social network). Asking whether the gender hierarchy found in most private and public sector organizations is mirrored in this inner circle of trustees, with men occupying the most influential positions in the structural and social networks, we find some male advantage in the structural network. Men predominate in holding most board seats, occupying multiple board seats, and in having slightly greater network centrality. By contrast, women hold the edge in the social network, with slightly greater centrality and higher levels of social integration. Women's disadvantage in the structural network is at least partly counterbalanced by their prominence in the social network of trustees in Louisville. Results indicate that the local nonprofit sector includes a small number of women (but no people of color) in leadership roles."

"Arrangements to certify that an organization's management systems meet standards of good practice are an increasingly prominent feature in the environment of public and private nonprofits. This paper reports an exploratory study of the issues that this phenomenon presents to managers and policy makers, drawing on the limited literature, and five case studies covering two different schemes. The main conclusions are that nonprofits can and do use these awards in very different ways, and hence the outcomes are diverse. These findings run counter both to the rational system assumptions on which such arrangements are based, and to the general thrust of institutional theory with its emphasis on isomorphism. Some implications for decision makers and future research are outlined."
803	2000	VOL	11:04	The Role of the Nonprofit Sector in Hong Kong's Development	"The recent handover of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China (PRC) brought Hong Kong worldwide attention and scrutiny. In the run up to the handover, the international media prominently featured stories about Hong Kong's freewheeling capitalism and the stability created by its administrative institutions. Lost in the media attention was the role of nonprofit organizations and the voluntary sector in Hong Kong's political and economic development. Although Hong Kong has a vibrant civil society, it has received little attention from scholars. This paper reviews the role of the third sector in Hong Kong's development. Among the issues the paper addresses are the legal codes that govern the creation and operation of nonprofit organizations in Hong Kong, the evidence regarding the role of the nonprofit sector in Hong Kong's development, particularly its relationship to the government and market sectors, and the implications of the 1997 transition for the nonprofit sector's role."
804	2001	VOL	12:01	The Role of NGOs in Strengthening the Foundations of South African Democracy	"This paper assesses the contribution of South African nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to the process of democratic consolidation. By drawing on a 1998 survey conducted among 270 NGOs, on several expert interviews, and on an analysis of the structures and programs of the umbrella body of South African NGOs (Sangoco), the author presents a multi-faceted picture of the activities of the South African NGO sector. The focus is on the NGOs role as (1) schools of democracy, (2) in bridging societal cleavages, and (3) in providing channels of interest representation for the most marginalized sections of the population. The paper concludes that the contribution of South African NGOs to the process of democratic consolidation is significant, but highly dependent on an enabling external environment."

Drawing on extensive fieldwork among three prominent HIV/AIDS nonprofit organizations in New York City, this paper shows how the kinds of relationships these nonprofit organizations are likely to form with state agencies are based on their embeddedness in the state nonprofit system of relations. Three forms of embeddedness are distinguished according to the type and regularity of state nonprofit contact direct, outsider, and mediating. Importantly, it is shown how the configuration of relations within which an organization is embedded determines many of the organization's constraints and opportunities."

The paper analyses the emergence, nature, and structures of CSOs in Palestine, and emphasizes the role of the public in democratization. In particular it assesses both the positive and negative facets of CSOs work from the perspective of their possible role in democratization. It is concluded that CSOs play a positive but limited role in the democratization of Palestinian society."

Data were derived from daily, weekly, or monthly newspapers and special nonprofit newsletters accessible through websites. Analysis of media reports of scandals involving NGOs was conducted to identify issues and trends in governance and management problems associated with this sector. The paper focuses on NGOs involved in the financing or delivery of health and human services. After highlighting some of the precedent-setting cases of NGO improprieties in the United States during the 1990s, prominent global cases of wrongdoing during the period 1998 2000 are reviewed. The underlying problems that allowed these cases to occur and their implications regarding NGO credibility and public trust are identified, and strategic options for enhancing accountability presented."

Drawing upon detailed case histories of two well-established NGOs in western India, it is demonstrated that (1) the case NGOs have been profoundly influenced by discourses prevailing during their initial, formative stages, (2) NGO behavior is subject to changes in global development discourses that are transmitted to them via a range of mechanisms including consultants, conditions of funding, and reporting requirements, and (3) these NGOs have been able to challenge and adapt certain discourses to suit their own needs and circumstances, sometimes even sparking wider structural change."
809	2001	VOL	12:02	Leadership in Voluntary Associations: The Case of the International Association of Women	"Three models of leadership in voluntary associations have been proposed in the literature: democratic leadership, oligarchy, and leadership by default. Through an intensive case study of leadership structure, differences in the attitudes of members and leaders at three hierarchical levels, and differences between the attitudes and behaviors of aspirants and nonaspirants to leadership in a women's service association, this article examines the degree of fit between these models and a specific organization. Data is drawn from questionnaires, annual reports, and interviews. The results fail to conform to any of the existing models, suggesting instead a fourth model, leadership for self-development in which leaders are motivated primarily by a desire to develop administrative and interpersonal skills."

This paper presents the results of a research project that has studied the new structures of devolved governance through the expectations and participation of voluntary organizations representing three marginalized or minority groupings: women, disabled people, and those from an ethnic minority background. The findings reveal that despite varying levels of expectation expressed by minority voluntary groups, active engagement of minority groups in policy making has been a feature of the Assembly's first months. Nevertheless, formidable challenges face both sectoral partners in the new system of governance, not least in creating organizational structures that facilitate partnership working in the devolved polity."

Do donors to nonprofit organizations care about whether nonprofit organizations pursue commercial activities? Do donors more approve commercial activities that are related to or advance the mission of a nonprofit organization than those commercial activities that do not? The paper uses data collected from donors and volunteers with one human services nonprofit organization in the United States. The principal conclusions are two. Most donors and volunteers have little interest in the sources of nonprofit organizations funds. Among the relatively small percentage of donors and volunteers who attend to use of commercial activities, the use of activities that are consistent with or advance the organization's mission is approved, and the use of commercial activities that do not advance the mission is relatively disapproved."

It is against this background that practitioners and academics are beginning to articulate their individual understandings of the role of the third sector in Irish society. This paper presents a framework developed from three questions to consider the place of the third sector in a modern democratic state. The questions are: What are the roles of the third sector in a society? What relationships exist between the third and other sectors? How are third sector organizations resourced within that societal context? Answering these questions contributes to a conceptualization of the third sector in Ireland, North and South."

This welcomed attention accentuates the need to specify the role of the third sector in promoting civil society, generally, and in promoting democratic civil society, specifically. This paper describes and examines the YES Campaign that had roots in the third sector of Northern Ireland and which conducted a nonpartisan campaign to win approval for the Belfast Agreement of April 1998. The case of the YES Campaign illustrates some direct and intentional roles of third sector organizations in promoting a more democratic civil society, and offers a basis for further study of these roles."
815	2001	VOL	12:03	Contexts and Constraints for NPOs: The Case of Co-operation Ireland	"This paper presents a case study and analysis of Co-operation Ireland, a nonprofit cross-border peace and reconciliation organization. The case description traces the interplay between the organization's development and its operating environment. Three broad, overlapping periods of relationships with different constituencies are identified. The requirements of managing these relationships and their impact on organizational development are highlighted. The pattern of financing of the organization is examined to identify critical, legitimizing relationships. Resource dependence and institutional theory are utilized to analyze the bases for legitimation of the organization over time. It is proposed that nonprofit organizations without independent resources are particularly sensitive to environmental constraints."
816	2001	VOL	12:03	"Organizational Fields and Third Sector Housing in Ireland, North and South"	"This paper applies organizational field analysis to compare the structure of the third sector housing fields in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Following preliminary accounts of history, structure, funding, and regulation, four key dimensions of field structure are compared: interaction, subgroups, structural equivalence, and patterns of domination. In both fields studied, early steering by the state into specialist roles has been overtaken by state funded expansion in general needs housing, increasing the dominance of larger organizations and tensions around voluntary sector identity. However, differences remain in the extent of domination and tightness of field structure, with greater emphasis on whole organization regulation, and adherence to professional and trade bodies in Northern Ireland. It is also shown how cross-border activity and the espousal of a European model will influence future trajectories."

The civic engagement model is based on the renewed interest among governments in the potential of voluntary organizations to contribute to the civic engagement of citizens. In the service delivery model, voluntary organizations are recruited to the task of delivering core social services. Drawing on data from disability-related voluntary organizations in Northern Ireland, this paper illustrates the impact of the service delivery partnership model on the development of voluntary action in the welfare field, and the relative paucity of resources allocated to participatory voluntary action and civic engagement. The consequent impact on the development of partnerships between the state and the voluntary sector is discussed."

Evidence form our study of U.K. voluntary organizations demonstrates relatively low uptake of the core networking technologies and applications essential to support such transformation. Friends of the Earth and The Samaritans are exceptions to this trend. Case studies of these organizations demonstrate that they are using advanced networked technologies to reconfigure key information flows and relationships, in support of enhanced campaigning and more effective user services. The extent to which these organizations are able to exploit the transformational potential that the technologies present is tempered by historically institutionalized relationships and values by which they are characterized."

In particular, the paper focuses on changes in INGO organizational structure, programming priorities, and relationships with the Government of Guatemala and local counterparts between 1993 and 2000. It is shown that the peacetime atmosphere has vastly improved INGO capacity to work in Guatemala, and that continued success depends on INGO adaptation to the new opening, governmental commitment to the Peace Accords, and increased INGO willingness to cooperate on large-scale, integrated projects."
820	2001	VOL	12:04	"Child Protection, Voluntary Organizations, and the Public Sector in Sweden"	"This paper presents an analysis of the role of Swedish voluntary organizations within the field of child protection as well as processes of institutionalization within such organizations. The empirical focus is on the two most important voluntary organizations within the field today, namely Radda Barnen (Save the Children) and BRIS (Children's Right in Society). And their importance within the child protection discourse, as well as their role as producers of welfare, is discussed. In the latter respect two different processes of professionalization, professionalization of volunteers and avant-garde professionalism are identified. It is demonstrated that the relationship between the state and voluntary organizations is a key issue when understanding the nature of the organizations and their role in the organizational landscape."

It answers four related questions: (1) How did these foundations understand civil society, and did they think there was a link between it and democracy? (2) How significant was their support for civil society from 1988 to 1996? (3) How did South Africa's democratization affect their grantmaking patterns? (4) Did the foundations favor professionalized NGOs over grassroots and decentralized organizations, and if so, was this the right approach? The empirical analysis of the South African case contributes to the general debate about the link between civil society and democracy, and the role of funders in supporting both."

Obvious disparities between the two countries exist when overall levels of giving are considered. In the United States, individual giving as a percentage of gross national or domestic product has consistently hovered around 2% of Gross Domestic Product. By contrast, charitable giving in the United Kingdom has yet to reach 1% of GDP. The paper identifies the differences in giving ethos and behavior in the two countries in relation to the complexity of the differences between the political structures, social attitudes, and the role of charitable giving in the two countries. In particular, the paper postulates a set of models generosity and altruism for explaining the differences."

However, a study of 33 NGOs in this region reveals that the strategies behind these projects tend to vary according to the particular group being addressed. NGO projects emphasizing Hungarian minorities tend to utilize network strategies to increase contact between Hungarians and titulars (Romanians, Slovaks, and Ukrainians), while projects for Roma tend to avoid network strategies, focusing exclusively on status-raising strategies. This paper presents the promises and shortcomings of both approaches, and concludes with an analysis addressing why NGOs should be less hesitant to apply network strategies to Roma projects as well as to Hungarian projects."
824	2002	VOL	13:01	Consumerism in Health Care: The Case of a U.K. Voluntary Sector HIV Prevention Organization	"This paper examines the potential for, and the contradictions inherent in, voluntary sector health service providers acting as consumer representatives. The paper examines a U.K. gay men's HIV prevention organization to consider whether members are united by their experiences of using services, whether their work involves consumerist strategies, if so whether these are influential, and what tensions emerge from the dual provider/consumer role. Fieldwork was carried out in 1997 98, examining, via documents and interviews, activity between 1992 and 1997. Qualitative analysis was performed. Consumer action is shown to emerge not so much from abstract constructions of consumer interest, but more from the particularities of consumption, which become politicized more powerfully through their attachment to other interests and ideologies."

In particular, the paper presents an identification theory of care and discusses how it shaped the conceptualization, collection, and analysis of the data in a year-long diary study of daily voluntary assistance. The findings from the BADS (1) theoretically confirm the identification theory of care, (2) methodologically capture how individuals perceive and carry out caring behavior as a unity, and (3rpar, empirically document the existence of a moral citizenship in America that is substantially more vigorous than is implied by the usual indicators of civic and political citizenship."
826	2002	VOL	13:01	The Structure and Resources of NGOs in Estonia	"The paper examines the present state of voluntary associations in Estonia their resources and fields of activity. First, the paper discusses two possible functions of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in the post-socialist social change: the opening up of participation channels complementary to those of representative democracy and the support to the state in fulfilling social welfare functions. A view stressing the latter function of the voluntary sector has hitherto dominated Estonian domestic political discussion. The actual capacity of Estonian NGOs is assessed on the basis of previous research and the results of a mail survey (779 responding organizations). The resources of the respondents are smaller than expected. Resources differ greatly between urban and rural associations, and between NGOs representing different fields of activity. The paper concludes with a discussion of the empirical findings and of the need for further research."

These perspectives, however, are not sufficient to account for the importance of China's particular historical and political culture. This paper discusses the development and future of NGOs in the context of current scholarly research as well as the role of China's historical and current sociopolitical situation."
828	2002	VOL	13:02	Explaining the Third Sector in South Korea	The paper presents the main characteristics and the distinctive nature of the South Korean third sector compared to most Western countries. Differences are explained in terms of cultural embededdness and political embededdness in particular with respect to the import of Confucianism (or neo-Confucianism) and of human rights abuse in articulation with a strong ideology of anticommunism that has been developed by a succession of dictatorial regimes since the end of the Japanese colonization of Korea. The paper concludes by highlighting positive factors for the future development of the third sector in Korea.
829	2002	VOL	13:02	Development NGOs and Political Participation of the Poor in Bangladesh and Nepal	"This paper examines the role of development NGOs (nongovernmental organizations) in furthering the political participation of the poor, with data from Bangladesh and Nepal. The topic is discussed from three aspects: the role of NGOs in prodemocracy movements, the issues raised by antiglobalization movements, and the extent of NGO involvement in local government elections. The paper draws on fieldwork conducted in two villages one in Bangladesh and the other in Nepal. It is concluded that development NGOs tend to contribute more to elite interests than to the democratic political participation of the poor."
830	2002	VOL	13:02	Group Dynamics in Development of the Poor: Experience from BRAC	"The groups deliberately formed by nongovernmental organizations to organize the poor for their development are often subgrouped for better performance. In this connection, the study investigates the extent subgroups contribute to group performance, the mechanisms that lead to the contribution of subgroups to group performance, and changes in the contribution of subgroups to the performance of a group. Altogether 239 Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee groups, i.e., village organizations (VOs), with and without subgroups were investigated. The VOs with subgroups performed better than those without subgroups. The performance of the VOs with subgroups, however, declined over time. One of the reasons why effectiveness of VOs with subgroups declined was the belief that pursuing subgroup responsibilities would not bring any personal gain for members."

The three case studies elaborated in the paper show that Philippine NGOs play important intermediary and bridging functions crucial for the success of multistakeholder partnerships. NGOs are well equipped for this because of their middle-class and professional nature and because of various characteristics like autonomy, flexibility, and the ability to mobilize resources."
832	2002	VOL	13:03	Civil Society and Democracy: The Israeli Experience	"Civil society has been considered pivotal to democracy, but the causes of its performance have remained controversial. According to one view the political context is a critical factor in shaping the contours of civil society. Another suggests that whether democracy prevails is contingent on society itself and the associations comprising it. In a test of these views it was assumed that if society prevails associations would vary by type. If the state is more important, then associations would be expected to score similarly on the democratic scale. It was also expected that variation among the types of performance would cut across group categories, reflecting general attributes of the polity. Data were derived from a survey conducted among voluntary associations in Israel (n = 360). Findings showed that (a) associations scored similarly on the democratic scale, (b) the scores for the democratic performance were not influenced by group category, and (c) the least performed function was integration."
833	2002	VOL	13:03	Media Publicity and the Voluntary Sector: The Case of Nonprofit Organizations in New York City	"Media publicity is an important resource for contemporary voluntary associations, but very little is actually known about the resources and organizational characteristics that are most important for getting media attention. To address this question, we collected and analyzed data on the organizational attributes and news publicity of 739 nonprofit organizations in New York City. We find that an organization's income, paid staff, membership size, and library resources are significantly related to getting media publicity, whereas the number of chapter affiliations is inversely related to publicity. Association type is also a significant factor that influences an organization's ability to get publicity. We discuss the implications that these findings have for current debates about advocacy and civic engagement in the nonprofit sector."

This paper investigates the situation with respect to voluntary sport organizations in a Norwegian context. The situation for voluntary and paid work is described and discussed with respect to different kinds of sport organizations. The empirical results show that voluntary work still is the foundation of most sport organizations, but that there are large differences between various types of organizations, and that voluntary work functions in complex interaction with other important economic and structural features of these organizations."

Although NGOs have become recognized actors in international affairs, particularly over the last decade, it has not yet been clearly defined what the term NGO encompasses. It is argued that two major tracks of NGO interpretations can be distinguished: the juridical approach, and the sociological perspective. In juridical studies, the emphasis is placed on the legal status of NGOs in the national context and their implications for international law. Sociological works, instead, are based on studies of societal actors, and try to capture the term while examining more specifically the composition and functions of NGOs in the transnational arena. Acknowledging both tracks, the paper concludes with a comprehensive definition of the term NGO."

It locates the analysis in a geohistorical framework, arguing that, as a distinct area of scholarship, contemporary civil society research is a two-track post-Cold War phenomenon exhibiting major shortcomings. A new type of dedicated research financing and process of allocation could redress today's research limitations in ways that will beneficially cross-fertilize parallel approaches and epistemological traditions while increasing the spread of centers dedicated to such knowledge generation. The analysis leads to suggestions for a civil society research agenda and investment principles."

However, most studies have been conducted on publicly traded investor-owned enterprises. Although the not-for-profit sector experienced explosive growth during the 1990s, little work has been devoted to understanding its executive compensation schemes and incentives arrangements. In the United States, recent Federal and State legislation has changed the landscape under which nonprofits must operate to avoid penalties for paying excessive compensation to its executives. Studies of compensation schemes under different organizational arrangements are limited. This paper uses the U.S. hospital industry to link the for-profit and nonprofit compensation and incentive literatures. It highlights selected for-profit executive compensation and incentive processes and suggests how some of these methods could be applied in a nonprofit setting."

Or is it, rather, a discursive political terrain open to many interpretations, not all of which might be progressive? A radical democratic content would be one way of filling out the empty signifier, which global civil society is, but not the only one."

"The international aid system forms a powerful structural force impacting organizational landscapes and civil societies all over the world in complex ways we do not yet understand. Dominant NGO research has failed to properly address this crucial issue, because of a conceptual, theoretical, and ideological tradition that is itself embedded in this very same system's normative, rhetorical agenda. This paper suggests some conceptual and theoretical approaches that should encourage more comparative research on the role of the development NGOs in shaping national and global civil societies"

Advocacy in these new agendas challenges prevailing models, which depict NGOs as mobilizing powerful governments and international organizations to influence a government's behavior. The patterns of international NGO political activity are diverse, sometimes restraining the power of international rules and authorities over individual governments, and require a new or broader model"

With this broadening and deepening of cross-border citizen action, however, troubling questions have arisen about their rights of representation and accountability the internal hierarchies of voice and access within transnational civil society are being highlighted. The rise of transnational grassroots movements, with strong constituency base and sophisticated advocacy capability at both local and global levels, is an important phenomenon in this context. These movements are formed and led by poor and marginalized groups, and defy the stereotype of grassroots movements being narrowly focused on local issues. They embody both a challenge and an opportunity for democratizing and strengthening the role of transnational civil society in global"

National differences are shown to be persistent and there is little evidence of Europeanization. It is argued that the impediments to the development of a global civil society are yet greater and that, despite the advent of antiglobalization protests, global civil society remains an aspiration rather than an accomplished fact"

Voluntas, now the journal of ISTR, started publishing in 1990. This paper reviews changes in topics, diversity of regions studied, and diversity of authors from ISTR conference papers and Voluntas articles to examine the state of research on the third sector. The findings show that ISTR and Voluntas have increased in the range of content, regions covered, and disciplinary mix. The paper also reviews progress made on third sector research and some challenges that lie ahead."
845	2003	VOL	14:01	Religious Nongovernmental Organizations: An Exploratory Analysis	"This paper represents the first systematic attempt at an analysis of religious nongovernmental organizations (RNGOs). Largely ignored as an organizational field, RNGOs constitute a new breed of religious actors shaping global policy an organizational hybrid of religious beliefs and social activism at local, national, and international levels. This paper proposes a definition of RNGOs, traces the emergence of RNGOs from an historical perspective, and situates them in their current religious and sociopolitical contexts. Drawing on interviews and documentary data from a sample of 263 United Nations-affiliated RNGOs, the author proposes an analytical framework to examine the religious, organizational, strategic, and service dimensions of these organizations. Religious nongovernmental organizations unique contributions to the redefinition of a just society as well as the sociopolitical challenges arising from their religious identity are discussed."

Results from a Belgian Survey on Civic Participation	"In the literature on a possible decline of participation levels, several factors are invoked as alleged causes for this trend. Most prominent among these are generational replacement, the spread of television, rising geographic mobility, increasing time pressure, marital instability, and the decline of religious affiliations. In Bowling Alone, Robert Putnam (Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community, Simon and Schuster, New York, 2000) lends credibility to the claim that these factors are at least related to the decline of participation levels in the United States, and might even be regarded as an underlying cause. In this paper, the author assesses whether these variables also have a bearing on the participation level of the Belgian population. The analysis of a Belgian survey (N = 1341) shows that for most of the invoked causes, the relation is not significant, although the decline in religious affiliation does seem a likely candidate for further research. The paper closes with some suggestions for future research on civic engagement."

It is noted that neither Unionist nor Republican accounts accord a significant or positive role to civil society in the reaching of a political settlement. It is only in what might be called the metropolitan liberal perspective that influence is attributed to the role of civil society in achieving a settlement. Two junctures at which civil society, centered on the third sector, played a prominent role in the peace process are analyzed: the Opsahl Commission before the launch of the peace process in 1993 and the nonparty Yes campaign during the referendum on the Belfast Agreement in May 1998. The paper then goes on to discuss why the influence of civil society has declined since the referendum, and draws attention to the conflict between the top-down implications of the consociational nature of the Belfast Agreement and the bottom-up promotion of political accommodation through civil society."

Drawing upon interviews with representatives from the nonprofit sector, the author argues that the experiences of NPOs in family policy-making vary considerably between countries because of the way state nonprofit relations operate. Social origins theory illustrates why these variations exist by pointing to broad societal influences on the nonprofit sector, but new empirical evidence presented here suggests that, in a particular policy field, other factors, such as the significance of the field on policy agendas, the strength of one particular organization in a specific cultural context, party ideology, and financial viability of the NPO, shape the role of organizations in the formulation of policies"

Following a brief discussion of partnership, two illustrations support a relative definition of partnership and its added value. The examples represent alternative approaches to improving public services through partnership work, the choice of which may depend on (1) the will of the partners to change particularly government, (2) the preexistence of effective public services, and (3) depth of mobilization and social capital sought. The examples similarly reveal alternative approaches to addressing partnership challenges either bureaucratically or through behavioral norms and organization culture. Implications of donors participation in such partnerships are highlighted."

Donor resources and recipient needs changed over time forcing constant adjustment in this environment, at times resulting in service overlap, inefficiency, and waste. However, the inter-relatedness of tasks in this war-torn country continually reminded players of the need for cooperative, coordinated action. Within a short time, intricate webs of interorganizational relationships emerged among donors, NGO implementers, and host nation players, at both ground and global levels. The research reported here is based on extensive interview material with a diverse range of informants."
851	2003	VOL	14:02	Collective and Reflexive Styles of Volunteering: A Sociological Modernization Perspective	"This paper presents a theory-guided examination of the (changing) nature of volunteering through the lens of sociological modernization theories. Existing accounts of qualitative changes in motivational bases and patterns of volunteering are interpreted against the background of broader, modernization-driven social-structural transformations. It is argued that volunteer involvement should be qualified as a biographically embedded reality, and a new analytical framework of collective and reflexive styles of volunteering is constructed along the lines of the ideal-typical biographical models that are delineated by modernization theorists. Styles of volunteering are understood as essentially multidimensional, multiform, and multilevel in nature. Both structural-behavioral and motivational-attitudinal volunteering features are explored along the lines of six different dimensions: the biographical frame of reference, the motivational structure, the course and intensity of commitment, the organizational environment, the choice of (field of) activity, and the relation to paid work."
852	2003	VOL	14:02	Networking Through Loose and Strong Ties: An Australian Qualitative Study	"Given the significant role attributed to community organizations by many social capital scholars, it is appropriate to investigate the dynamics of that process. In particular, Woolcock and Narayan (World Bank Res. Obs. 15(2): 225 249, 2000) have suggested that bridging and bonding are two different types of connections, whereby bridging is associated with loose ties across communities and bonding is associated with strong ties within a limited group. This qualitative study explores the loose and strong ties of 39 participants connected through community organizations in rural and urban New South Wales. The results suggest that loose and strong ties are not synonymous with bridging and bonding. In general loose and strong ties differ in degree rather than in kind and people prefer to bridge through their strong ties. The interesting exceptions were ties to professionals, which were highly trusted but defined as loose ties. It is suggested that a model for a high social capital society might be a chain of well-bonded groups each with strong links to some other groups."

Central points are a different approach to voluntary participation, new public relations, and a rearrangement of public-private partnerships. As a result, Catholic welfare has become activated in both countries. While the shrinking of the overall influence of Catholic charity seems inevitable, there is more creative agency, and less programming by the old stakeholders. The national paths of change, however, differ in that Caritas, defending its service approach, is confronted with a process of de-institutionalization while Secours catholique, though giving particular emphasis to voluntary action is entering into further institutionalization."

In particular, the paper explores: (1) idealism and non-idealism as properties of social theories about voluntary action, (2) idealist and non-idealist social thought in voluntary organizations, (3) pro-state idealist social thought in official or governmental circles on relationships with voluntary action, and changes in such thought and in government relationships with voluntary action in the 1970s, (4) innovations in the ways of classifying voluntary organizations, and (5) new approaches to the study of voluntary action. The paper also comments on voluntary action and the third way."

Relying on personal interviews with participants and observers, the paper examines two key political events to illustrate these issues the debate about the proposed Law on Foundations, and the 1998 Parliamentary elections."

This is particularly true for nonprofit organizations. The costs of nonprofits can be easily measured, however, not captured by conventional accounting is the value of their nonmonetized resources such as volunteers. This paper argues that social accounting for nonprofits would benefit by creating accounting statements that combine the economic and social impact of an organization (referred to as an integrated approach). After discussing some historic examples of integrated social accounting, the paper presents a Canadian case study in which the value added by volunteers of a nonprofit organization is combined with its financial statements in an Expanded Value Added Statement. By combining social and economic information, a very different performance story of the organization emerges."

The vast body of research and evaluation generated by the 1996 welfare reforms largely overlooked nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) despite their substantial historical and contemporary involvement in the delivery of social services to low-income populations. Therefore, this paper presents a unique assessment of PRWORA's implications based on the perspective of 90 social service NGOs operating in the Detroit metropolitan area. Examination of their services, staffing, budgets, and clients reveals many changes experienced by NGOs between 1996 and 2000 related to the welfare reforms. Overall, the findings suggest an increased role for social service NGOs in the public welfare system as well as concerns regarding their capacity to adequately fulfill this growing responsibility in the future."

It draws on empirical research to examine how legitimacy is defined, both by third sector organizations and by those they target within government. The paper argues that while many third sector organizations give high priority to political forms of legitimacy in the sense of participatory structures and accountability to members and beneficiaries government is generally more likely to give priority to technical forms of legitimacy, e.g., the quality of research and the ability to implement policy. Nonetheless, political legitimacy is still important, first because this is the form of legitimacy that third sector organizations claim for themselves and second because, as government gives way to governance with an increase in partnerships and collaboration, the dilemmas faced by third sector organizations in achieving political legitimacy are being faced on a broader canvas."
859	2003	VOL	14:03	Irish Credit Unions: Exploring the Gender Mix	"Credit unions are voluntary cooperative financial institutions. At present there are 621 credit unions in Ireland serving two million members. Credit unions espouse the principle of gender inclusiveness, which is viewed as a fundamental cooperative concept. Based on a survey of 500 Irish credit unions, this study explores the role of women in credit unions. Judged against participation rates for women in the labor market and in specific organizations such as trade unions, the study suggests that gender balance in credit unions is superior to that elsewhere in Irish society. There is, however, some evidence of gender imbalance in the composition of credit union boards with this being most visible for key decision-making positions such as Chair and Vice-Chair. It also emerges that gender imbalance becomes more pronounced for larger credit unions supporting the contention that women are found in greater numbers on small and less well-connected not-for-profit boards."

We position volunteering and voluntarism as core constitutive phenomena in and of nonprofit organizations and the nonprofit sector more generally, and examine volunteer agency in action. Developing a model drawn from neoinstitutional theory and adopting an ethnographic approach, the paper illustrates theoretically and empirically how volunteers create and revise institutional orders operative within organizations in ways hitherto poorly articulated and understood."

This paper examines the policy process towards the establishment of the MDDA as a partnership between the state, capital, and civil society within the constraints of South Africa's re-entry into a global economy that privileges free market solutions to developmental problems. Under these conditions, do partnerships between the state, the private sector, and civil society facilitate or hinder the achievement of social objectives aimed primarily at uplifting the poor and marginalized?"

This is a common answer to survey type investigations into charitable giving. In this paper we adopt a law and finance approach to investigate the validity of this contention in the Australian context. We develop an Accountability Rights variable and relate that variable to charitable donations. The relationship between the two is statistically weak and not robust.

A case study of a community mobilization of middle-class volunteers to provide one-on-one support to families in poverty shows both possibilities and limitations. Volunteers provide social support to families in poverty, thus alleviating social isolation. Volunteers learn about systemic forces that cause poverty, its effects on families and communities, and about themselves and their capacities to engage in poverty work. However, social isolation is but one of many problems associated with poverty, and even a more knowledgeable amateur volunteer corps cannot take the place of substantial social, economic, and political change."

A large Lottery grant can facilitate rapid expansion and may necessitate a degree of organizational learning for which groups are often unprepared. The paper suggests that a Lottery grant may lead to changes in the ways in which an organization identifies itself, or is identified by stakeholders. However, these changes may not be accompanied by a corresponding change in the organization's capacity or underlying cultural ethos. On the basis of the primary research carried out in 2003, the paper examines the implications of these changes for individual organizations and for the sector more widely."

Volunteer motivation also provides an excellent research area for investigating the wider sociological theme of late-modern participation. This study, based on the data from 18 interviews, explores volunteer motivation utilizing a phenomenological approach to individual experience and the meaning of volunteerism. Using a phenomenological approach illuminates the nature of volunteer motivation more holistically. The research includes 767 motivational elements in 47 themes and develops an innovative four-dimensional octagon model of volunteer motivation the theoretical and practical applications of which are discussed."

While there is an increasing recognition that grassroots associations warrant greater attention from researchers, the paper argues that there must be an accompanying call to broaden methodological approaches used to understand them. Accordingly, it is advanced that the meanings associated with grassroots associations are embodied in narrative and illuminated by its study. To demonstrate this claim, the paper outlines explanatory and descriptive approaches to narrative inquiry, offers examples as illustrations of each approach, and discusses the analysis that accompanies them. In doing so, the paper attempts to foster an appreciation for narrative inquiry as a new method with which to study grassroots associations."

The free listing technique, adapted from the field of cognitive anthropology, was used to achieve this task. Fifteen representatives of a variety of Argentinean nonprofit organizations participated in the study. Among the highest rated characteristics were: searching for new ways, solutions, and unconventional forms of work, adapting to new times, suggesting new forms for solving problems, and reflecting over organizational activities and actions. Rated as least characteristic were: encouraging role changes within teams, focusing on organizational mission, not being afraid of failure, and generosity (sharing information with other organizations)."

This paper draws on varying theoretical perspectives to explore their respective contributions to our knowledge of NPOs. The two longstanding and contrasting disciplines of economics and sociology have contributed most, traditionally, to the study of NPOs. However, neither of these disciplines has resolved all the dilemmas associated with NPOs. The standard economic model does not apply well to the distinctive nonmarket situation of NPOs. The sociological perspectives offer interesting insight, but fail to develop plans of action for NPOs. However, both of these traditional perspectives are starting to be eclipsed by the focus on marketing research."

Many nonprofit organizations are now mimicking the management techniques of for-profit organizations. Referring to prevailing economic, psychological, and management theories, this paper deals with pay-for-performance plans and specifies reasons for their introduction into nonprofit organizations. The determinants of pay-for-performance effectiveness are analyzed with special emphasis on the motivational determinants. The results of the analysis are incorporated into a model of pay-for-performance effectiveness. Referring to theoretical reasoning as well as empirical studies, this paper analyzes how the motivational determinants of pay-for-performance effectiveness are coined in different types of nonprofit organizations. The paper ends with a discussion in which the author presents an alternative explanation for the introduction of pay-for-performance plans into nonprofit organizations and some suggestions for future research."
870	2004	VOL	15:02	Strategic Management of Public Interest Organizations	"This paper argues that strategic management of a public interest organization not only needs to be aimed at the interests it represents, but it also has to incorporate the organization's internal workings. The functioning of a public interest organization is seen to suffer from a primary dilemma of membership and influence and a secondary dilemma of representation and control. If these dilemmas are not handled adequately, the public interest organization will suffer from a vicious circle of contradiction and conflict, eventually threatening the organization's long-term viability. A case study is elaborated to empirically underpin this proposition."

Applying econometric tests, we find the best-specified model is two-way fixed effects, which controls for organization-specific and time-specific factors. Results suggest that U.S. higher education, hospital, and scientific research NPOs fund-raise to the point where the marginal fund-raising dollar brings in zero dollars of donations, donor demand for output of hospitals and scientific research NPOs is price inelastic and price elastic, respectively, and results are not sensitive to specification of price."

Two hundred and seventeen investment bankers, accountants, and corporate lawyers, aged under 40 years, earning more than £50,000 annually and working in the City of London were questioned about their attitudes and behavior in relation to charitable giving. Significant differences emerged between the donor behavior characteristics of males and females. A conjoint analysis revealed that whereas men were more interested in donating to the arts sector in return for social rewards (invitations to gala events and black-tie dinners, for example), women had strong predilections to give to people charities and sought personal recognition from the charity to which they donated."
873	2004	VOL	15:03	Managing Change in Nonprofit Organizations: Insights from the UK Charity Retail Sector	"Moves toward increased professionalism are now an almost taken-for-granted aspect of change across the nonprofit sector both in the United States and in the United Kingdom. This paper uses the case of UK charity retail to explore the impacts of this move to professionalism, on managers at the local level. In doing so it seeks to develop appropriate techniques for managing change both in charity retail and more broadly, in nonprofit organizations per se. The professionalization of charities trading activities has resulted in a series of changes at the local level, these include the introduction of new forms of staff, changes to policies regarding the sourcing, pricing, and presentation of stock, and an increased emphasis on sales targets, league tables, and incentive schemes designed to motivate managers to increase sales. These policies set at head office level have had significant impact on the day-to-day working experiences of branch managers. This paper explores managers reactions to these changes and examines the extent to which such policies could be said to be successful. To conclude, recommendations are made as to the most appropriate approaches to professionalizing charity retail operations. These conclusions are broadened to offer insights into appropriate techniques for managing change in nonprofit organizations."

It underlines the contribution these associations have made toward broadening the concept and standard parameters of volunteer organizations, providing basic social welfare services, and integrating the disadvantaged into the mainstream of society. The paper focuses on some SCs organizational aspects, highlighting the many traditional and advantageous business features, the ease with which they have access to financial instruments, and their ability to activate wider social projects. Given their recent spreading in Italy, where the Third Sector is less developed than in other Western countries, SCs incorporate working modalities that could also be of interest and relevance to other countries. To adopt this type of organization, however, calls for adequate competencies and protection under specific laws because they are, on the whole, still small-sized and somewhat fragile."

Since then, as a consequence of legal, fiscal, and cultural restrictions, it has developed characteristics that are markedly different to those of other nonprofit sectors. This paper focuses on one such characteristic that makes the French nonprofit sector virtually unique, that is the restrictions imposed on social entrepreneurism. It was not until July 17, 2001 that a new organizational form called Societes Cooperatives d'Int_r't Collectif (SCIC) was created specifically to address this anomaly. This paper discusses the context within which this organizational form was created, and the potential advantages that it offers in respect to facilitating the development of social enterprises. The paper also explains why a specific organizational form was required and why it was placed outside the nonprofit sector. It concludes by identifying potential problems concerning organizational effectiveness in delivering socially beneficial services and the difficulties that may arise as a consequence of SCIC's unique governance structure."

Governance of HIV/AIDS and Civil Society	"This paper locates NGOs dealing with HIV/AIDS problems in sub-Saharan Africa into the larger governance context within which they function. This aims at a theoretical shift to assess the aspirational characteristics for the agency of NGOs that are used to legitimate contracting out implementation of internationally designed HIV/AIDS policies to these organizations. The paper interrogates the nature and impact of the governance structure on NGOs and then looks at the implications of this for HIV/AIDS. The questioning is based on a juxtaposition of the perspective of international policy fora in relation to civil society organizations with the way NGO work is perceived by the people at the receiving end of the policies. The paper suggests that as part of the international governance structure, NGOs are limited within the policy frameworks created by this structure. Furthermore, due to their organizational characteristics, NGOs lack capacity to establish sustainable long-term interventions relevant for sociocultural change as perceived by people themselves."
877	2004	VOL	15:04	Global Complexity and Global Civil Society	"This paper argues that recent struggles against neoliberal axioms such as free trade and open markets have led to a militant reframing of global civil society by grassroots social movements. It contests that this struggle to invest the concept of global civil society with transformative potential rests upon an identifiable praxis, a strange attractor that disturbs other civil society actors, through its re-articulation of a politics that privileges self-organization, direct action, and direct democracy. The paper further suggests that the emergence of this antagonistic orientation is best understood through the lens of complexity theory and offers some conceptual tools to begin the process of analyzing global civil society as an outcome and effect of global complexity."

The paper draws on the analysis of new and existing research into the dimensions of NGO leadership highlighting the importance of both individual attributes and contextual relevance. Effective NGO leaders are able to balance a range of competing pressures from different stakeholders in ways that do not compromise their individual identity and values. Leadership development programs therefore need to focus on both the values and identity of individual leaders while also assisting leaders understand and proactively respond to their rapidly changing external environment. We conclude that there is an urgent need to build the capacity of NGOs to develop their leadership capability. Unless systems and processes to support this work are put in place then the apocryphal warning trees die from the top will have more than a ring of truth in it.

A content analysis of media reports of scandals over the past four years involving NGOs was conducted to identify issues and trends in governance and management problems. The analysis is confined to NGOs that are involved in the financing and/or delivery of health and human services in order to facilitate comparisons. International and U.S. cases of wrongdoing, covering the gamut of embezzlement to mismanagement, are identified and the common elements and unique features of these cases are examined. The underlying problems that allowed these cases to occur and their implications in regard to NGO credibility and public trust are identified and options for enhancing accountability explored."

News Publicity and Voluntary Organizations in Canada	"This paper reports exploratory data from a broader study that examines media representations of the voluntary sector in Canada. It specifically identifies the resources and organizational attributes of Canadian voluntary groups that appear to be important for receiving mainstream news coverage. The data identifies four sets of characteristics of more than 500 voluntary organizations: demographic variables, association type, noneconomic resources, and economic expenditures. These characteristics are examined in terms of their relationship to news coverage. The data suggest that area of activity is significantly related to the amount of media attention that organizations receive. However, the amount of media attention that an organization receives is most strongly influenced by its yearly budget. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to both current debates about advocacy in the voluntary sector and important contextual developments that are transforming the communication environment in which charities and nonprofit organizations in Canada operate. We also draw comparisons to news coverage of the voluntary sector in other liberal democratic countries."

Based on neo-institutional theory, the paper explains such isomorphism in terms of these organizations' subordination and dependency, the uncertainties they face, and the networks of experts of which they are a part. The analysis uses the nonprofit component of a 2001 2002 random sample of Australian employment organizations. It finds surprisingly little isomorphism in this subsample and few differences in isomorphism according to the level of the factors thought to produce similarity. The discussion of the findings focuses on the suitability of the nonprofit sector as the appropriate organizational field within which isomorphism involving these organizations is likely to be produced. Industries, which include all organizations that produce the same product or service, be they nonprofit, for-profit, or government, may be more appropriate interactional fields for the development of isomorphism."

Both research projects were contract research, conducted to inform policy and therefore were not designed to build on theoretical insights. However, from the results the research developed an understanding of the interrelated pressures on the voluntary sector in sport, which was informed by theory. This paper describes the pressures and relates them to previous research into volunteers. Contextualizing the issues faced by volunteers in sports organizations suggests several questions for further academic work, not only focused on sports volunteers, but the voluntary sector in general. In particular, are the pressures experienced by the voluntary sector in UK sport common to sports volunteers in other countries, and to what extent are they also a reflection of general pressures on the voluntary sector?"

This statist corporatist regime displays the hybrid character of both a statist and a corporatist regime: its statist character can be seen in the high degree of autonomy of the state, its tendency to limit freedom of association, and the low commitment to social provision. Its corporatist character is evident in the high level of participation by designated nonprofit organizations in selected areas of social provision under state funding. It is shown how the development of this nonprofit regime was historically shaped by four factors, namely, the interest of the colonial state in maintaining domination, economic and public financial policy, the historical formation of the welfare system, and political regime change. The findings illustrate the distinct historical forces and the path of development in an Asian state that might affect nonprofit development."

The effects and consequences of contracting on organizational practices, accountability, and services were explored through interviews and focus groups with executive directors, board members, line staff, government representatives, and the United Way. Results show that a significant proportion of funding comes from provincial government contracts. The funding climate is uncertain, and there is considerable confusion, stress, and time involved with the contracting process. Accountability requirements are demanding and nonprofit organizations (NPOs) express concern about a shift to a business management model. Recommendations include a need for increased collaboration between NPOs, a body that speaks for the voluntary sector, and improved relationships between NPOs and government funders."

In a research project using a combined qualitative quantitative approach, the motivation of 118 young Swiss adults who showed an interest in international volunteering was investigated. Qualitative analysis revealed 12 different motives which could be categorized into three different groups: A first group called Achieving something positive for others, a second group named Quest for the new, and a third group of motives labeled Quest for oneself. Motivations of young Swiss adults for international volunteering clearly show the characteristics of reflexive volunteers. Most respondents displayed a combination of motives while for only 11% of them altruism (Achieving something positive for others) was the one and only driving force behind their interest in international volunteering. The inductively constructed typology of motives can be a useful planning device for organizations that run or intend to set up an international volunteering program for young adults."
886	2005	VOL	16:02	Appreciating Impact: Evaluating Small Voluntary Organizations in the United Kingdom	"Within the mixed economy of care in the United Kingdom there are debates about the ways in which impact can be evaluated, in order to shape funding and policy decisions. One of the tensions evident in this debate is whether the evaluation approach should reflect the perspectives and goals of the voluntary organizations and their members, or whether evaluation should reflect the wider goals of the whole system of provision. The former runs the risk of being insular and self-congratulatory, while the latter may be inappropriate and dismissive of achievements. This paper explores this tension by reporting on a study that used Appreciative Inquiry to evaluate 10 small-scale not-for-profit schemes for older people. The data indicated some unexpected and long-term impacts that demonstrated the distinctiveness of the sector. Subsequently the findings were mapped on to the impact grid developed by Wilding and Lacey (2003). While this was straightforward at the levels of individuals and interorganizationally, it was more difficult at the sector/community level, suggesting that more work needs to be done to bring these two perspectives together."

"Using a sample of 645 voluntary organizations in Canada, this study explores the differences between women's voluntary organizations and gender-neutral organizations in their propensity to form a bridging or a bonding interorganizational relationship. The results suggest that not only do women's organizations in Canada collaborate more than gender-neutral organizations, but also the tendency to have bridging or bonding relationships is significantly different. The factors predisposing women's organizations to have collaborators inside or outside their network seems to be affected by how much the environmental changes in Canada impact their survival and whether the nature of the causes they support makes them an attractive partner. For gender-neutral organizations the tendency to bridge or bond seems to relate more to traditional organizational characteristics, such as size and staffing efficiency."

The results suggest that boards tend to be closed, elitist circles. Most organizations use mainly informal means to recruit new board members. The most important selection criteria were those related to interpersonal relationships, willingness to contribute time, and expressing an interest in working for the organization."

Drawing on research conducted during 2002 2003 at the Centre for Voluntary Action Studies at the University of Ulster and funded by the Royal Irish Academy, it is argued that the way that voluntary and community organizations developed in Ireland's two jurisdictions after the partition of the island in 1922 illuminates debates on the role of states in structuring the civic space in which voluntary action occurs. It illustrates, in particular, the interaction of state policy drivers with the cultural and ideological forces that shape voluntary action. Analysis lends support to the view that state action, together with cultural trends and social capital resources, is the crucial determinant of how the voluntary sector develops in a jurisdiction."

The efforts of the Philippine government to enhance development by encouraging the extraction of the nation's mineral resources by foreign corporations is discussed, as is the opposition of Philippine civil society to these efforts. This opposition to nonferrous metals mining has involved protests, litigation, administrative proceedings, and implementation of mining moratoriums by local governments. The paper concludes with an examination of the respective costs and benefits of a mining-based development paradigm in the context of the way in which many Filipinos view foreign extraction of their nation's resources."

It was hypothesized that negative experiences downwardly moderated (i) the impact of the charity's internal market activities on satisfaction and commitment, and (ii) the influences of certain job attributes (autonomy, teamworking, and supervisory support) on these variables. Three personal characteristics (affect intensity, vulnerability to stress, and a person's reasons for having become a volunteer) were also posited to moderate the effects of negative experiences on job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Linkages between the last two variables and a volunteer's desire to provide high-quality client services were explored. The results indicated strong connections between job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and a volunteer's personal commitment to providing high-quality services. Levels of organizational commitment were influenced positively and significantly by the charity's internal marketing activities and negatively by the number of unpleasant client-contact experiences that a volunteer had to endure."

It explores the extent and character of giving, who gives, to whom, with what intention? The survey results revealed that South Africa is richly resourced with a diverse and multicultural spectrum of giving behaviors, which are commonplace in everyday life. The spectrum of giving behaviors is so diverse in shape and form that it contradicts many of the basic assumptions of the philanthropic literature, which locate the act of giving primarily in the domain of the wealthy and powerful."

Our inquiry is informed by findings of US scholars that show that the adoption of a recommended set of volunteer management practices is related to the level of effectiveness achieved with volunteer involvement in NPOs. The paper advances a path model to explain volunteer program effectiveness, with volunteer management practices the crucial intermediate variable. Based on data collected in a survey of Almaty (Kazakhstan) NPOs in 2004, the empirical analysis yields considerable support for a path model that focuses on both the adoption of these practices and the attainment of program effectiveness. Given the heterogeneity of NPOs, not every organization can be expected to benefit from the adoption of the recommended practices. Nevertheless, results suggest that they offer one workable means for successfully integrating volunteers."

Two major changes over a 10-year period are studied to show that strategic management in high dependency situations requires a continual attention to the organization's relationships and interactions with the forces in its environment, and a continuous management of the process by which change takes place. The basic position advanced is that: strategy in philanthropic organizations is more effective in ensuring survival and growth when the search for autonomy is seen as irrelevant and when dependence is seen as an unavoidable fact that should shape behavior. A set of propositions helps conceptualize the findings and is offered as a guide for further research."

It argues that the World Bank is pursuing a conscious program to build a global elite governance system similar to Bank vice-president J. F. Rischard's concept of global issues networks, in which experts from business, government, and civil society will set globally binding social and economic policies. There is a risk of co-optation of international NGOs into this autocratic global managerial system."

They are also rarely subject to empirical testing and subsequent theoretical development. This paper reports on research to apply Kuhnle and Selle's (2002) relational typology, which characterizes the experience of Britain, to a study of Scottish and English voluntary organizations relations with government. Contrary to Kuhnle and Selle, the paper demonstrates  through survey data  a divergence between Scotland and England, within the British context, and advances the case for further testing of such conceptual typologies. The methodological challenges in moving from a theoretical framework to a research design capable of field application, using survey methods, are illustrated and discussed. Further directions for theoretically led work are suggested."

The Transformation of Voluntary Action in the Czech Union for Nature Protection	"After the fall of state-socialism, efforts were made to build democracy by creating civil society organizations (CSOs) and forming independent nonprofit sectors across Central and Eastern Europe. However, most of these efforts ignored the mass organizations, state-sponsored interest groups, and quasi-independent associations in existence for many years. To understand how the transition affected existing associations and the forms of volunteerism they promoted, this paper investigates changes in the Czech Union for Nature Protection (_SOP), an organization that has endured since 1979. Here, it is found that rather than retaining its emphasis on classical modes of voluntary action and participant interaction, _SOP favors professionally managed activities designed to attract financial support. The case suggests that some of the participatory practices and collectivist norms advanced by associations in socialist times are being weakened as these groups attempt to secure the resources necessary to survive."

It begins with an investigation into social learning within problem domains and into the ways in which such domain learning builds perspectives and capacities for effective action among domain organizations and institutions. It suggests that domain learning involves problem definition, direction setting, implementation of collective action, and performance monitoring. Transnational civil society actors appear to take five roles in domain learning: (1) identifying issues, (2) facilitating voice of marginalized stakeholders, (3) amplifying the importance of issues, (4) building bridges among diverse stakeholders, and (5) monitoring and assessing solutions. The paper then explores the circumstances in which transnational civil society actors can be expected to make special contributions in important problem domains in the future."
899	2006	VOL	17:01	Towards an Inclusive Social Policy for the UK: The Need for Democratic Deliberation in Voluntary and Community Associations	"In western capitalist societies the state has become increasingly criticized for its inadequacy as a mechanism for distributing welfare inclusively. In particular, it has been criticized for its lack of flexibility in meeting the needs of increasingly plural populations, and for being too distant to enable service users to participate in the meeting of their welfare needs. Consequently, in many countries, including the United Kingdom, voluntary and community associations have been used to distribute welfare with the belief that it can remedy the defects of universal state provision. This paper suggests the voluntary and community sector can only achieve this if the organizations are democratically organized, ensuring participation from staff and users. Moreover, participation should be based around the norms of deliberative democracy. The paper argues that this form of participation will best ensure that the needs, preferences, and interests of subordinate groups are included in social policy delivery, due to the fostering of public reason."
900	2006	VOL	17:01	Toward a Descriptive Model of Humanitarian Assistance Coordination	"This paper argues that the operating environment of humanitarian assistance is best conceived as an interorganizational social network or regime and that the problem of power and authority in such situations must be re-founded or reconceived accordingly. This contention is developed to contribute to an important ongoing dialogue among analysts concerning how humanitarian aid may most effectively be delivered in the context of a realistic appraisal of the structural and operating conditions in which it is offered. The paper first outlines the primary elements of the organizational environment in which humanitarian efforts must proceed, next suggests a way of thinking about how one might conceive of those conditions that builds on recent work, and then sketches the elements of a strategic contingency approach to the humanitarian assistance coordination dilemma. This analytical frame leads one to rethink assumptions concerning how best to conceptualize both the environment and the behavior of humanitarian organizations engaged in providing assistance in emergency situations and to suggest that theory building for this domain of study should now turn to a network-based and strategically contingent perspective for its foundation."
901	2006	VOL	17:01	The Role of Nonprofit Advocacy Organizations in Australian Democracy and Policy Governance	"Australia, like many Western liberal democracies, has experienced an unprecedented shift toward market driven policy governance in the past decade, influenced heavily by the demands of globalization but also the dominance of conservative ideas of liberal democracy and market oriented neoliberalism. In this context nonprofit advocacy organizations (NPAOs) have not only been subject to criticism and a reduction in governmental support, but have had their legitimacy challenged and questioned. This paper responds to an audible, visible, and highly contestable critique of NPAOs by exploring their contemporary place and role in Australian democracy. This discussion relies on a review of some key ideas and theories of liberal democracy and an overview of the current Australian context in which NPAOs operate, particularly in regard to their participation in policy governance. A key observation about how integral NPAOs are to ensure an active and open democracy, challenges the current directions of Australian governance and suggests a need for reflection on what actually constitutes a fully functioning democracy that fits the demands of the twenty-first century."

Museum Merchandising, Nonprofit Commercialization, and the Case of the Metropolitan Museum in New York"	"This paper reviews some of the underpinnings of the current commercialization debate in the nonprofit sector, based on an analysis of Metropolitan Museum of Art data from 1960 to 2002. The case suggests at least two avenues for additional research: First, while analysts tend to see the origins of the commercialization phenomenon in the fiscal setbacks of the 1980s, the economic crisis of the 1970s and the resulting erosion of endowment funds may also have been an as of yet unexplored driving force behind the commercialization trend. Second, current conceptual frameworks of the phenomenon adequately explain the motivations behind the observable rise of the museum's commercial activities. However, the changing rationales as well as economic fortunes of commercial activities in this case highlight the need for a better understanding of the long-term effects and consequences of commercial activity by nonprofit organizations, particularly in light of the current push for increased entrepreneurialism."

Competitive conditions within the voluntary sector have pushed nonprofits along this same path. However, no systematic Canadian research reports on the attitudes, social norms, benefits sought, expectations, opportunities, experiences, or behaviors of sub-communities in the voluntary sector. This paper examines philanthropic behavior by religion using data from the Statistics Canada 2000 National Survey of Giving, Volunteering and Participating. The paper compares and contrasts the voluntary and philanthropic behaviors of the Canadian population across religious groups, compares and contrasts the motivations for and perceived impediments against such behaviors, and articulates and examines a model that traces the influence of religion on voluntary and philanthropic behavior in Canada's multi-cultural society."

It was hypothesized that individual cognitive style, intrinsic motivation, leadership behaviors, job design, cultural norms of diversity, and work group relations would be related to employee creativity. Sixty nonprofit organizations were randomly sampled from the Database of Lithuanian Nonprofit Organizations and packets containing questionnaires were mailed to the organizations that agreed to participate. One hundred and twenty two questionnaires were returned out of 180 total (67.8% response rate). Results showed that innovative cognitive style, intrinsic motivation, and cultural norms for diversity were the most important predictors, explaining 41.5% of variance in employee creativity. Suggestions for hiring and staff development practices are provided along with implications for future research."

The argument is developed through an ethnographic case study of a nonprofit hybrid organization (in the United States) that is training welfare recipients in their own in-house businesses. First, this paper provides an overview of the commercial trends in the nonprofit sector and the rise of social purpose enterprises. Then, employing key concepts from neo-institutional theory, the author proposes framing nonprofit-business hybrids as organizations positioned in two different organizational fields each necessitating different internal organizational technologies to elucidate the structural tensions that can emerge inside these new hybrid models. Internal organizational tensions identified in the case study are highlighted. Finally, the proposed use of organizational field theory developed from the case analysis is discussed in terms of social enterprise more generally."
906	2006	VOL	17:02	The Forms and Structure of International Voluntary Service	"International voluntary service (IVS) has a significant and growing presence worldwide. IVS is a policy and program tool used for international development aid, humanitarian relief, and promotion of international understanding. In the last century, forms of IVS have proliferated, while research on scope, effectiveness, and impacts has lagged behind. We propose a typology that addresses duration, nature of service, and degree of internationality. Further, we identify IVS networks and support organizations that bolster the capacity of IVS sending and hosting organizations, and in this process create large and little recognized international institutions of cooperation. Building on the typology, we suggest program, policy, and research implications to advance knowledge of the role of IVS, its role in global civil society, and impacts it may have on human conditions and cross-cultural understanding."

The paper discusses the means governments use to control third sector activity that they view as potentially linked to terrorism, the need for comparative analysis of these measures, and the role of the third sector and scholars in recognizing the responsibilities of governments to prevent third sector organizations being used in terrorism while preserving the independence and vitality of the third sector."

There is concern that these approaches are constantly undermining the mission of community service nonprofit organizations (Darcy, 2002). In this research, we analyzed the management of funding relationships by examining dynamics within a nonprofit funding relationship in New Zealand. Through focus groups we explored the relationship between 17 representatives from nonprofit organizations and four Board members of a funding Trust. The management of this funding relationship was characterized by an appreciation of the diverse nature of nonprofit organizations, a balance between trust and control, and communication. We suggest that elements of these dynamics could be incorporated into nonprofit funding relationships in order to challenge an over-reliance on audit culture systems, and to re-establish relationships characterized by interaction between nonprofit organizations and their funders. Finally, we call for future research in this area."

Some 461 Italian young adults (aged 24 31) involved in voluntary activities with children and adolescents were considered. Referring to Omoto and Snyder's functionalist and motivational framework, a Ward's method cluster analysis was performed to identify specific patterns of motivations originating from the aggregation of 4 factors of motivation (social, career, ego-protective, and values) measured with the Voluntary Function Inventory (VFI). The results show that young volunteers are inspired by a distinctive and composite pattern of motivations, including both self and other-oriented motivations. Multiple motivations underlying the activities are associated to satisfaction and good integration in the organization confirming that people spurred by more than one motivation are less vulnerable to costs related to the activity and are more likely to maintain a longer involvement."

However, little has been written comparing and contrasting American and European conceptions of social enterprise resulting in difficulty communicating on the topic and missed opportunities to learn and build on foreign experience. To address this need, this paper compares and contrasts American and European social enterprise through an extensive review of literature from the two regions and discussions with social enterprise researchers on both sides of the Atlantic. It outlines the definitions of social enterprise used by American and European academics and practitioners, identifies historical factors promoting and shaping different conceptions of social enterprise, and highlights the differing institutional and legal environments in which it operates. It concludes by identifying what Americans and Europeans can learn from each others' experience with social enterprise."

912	2006	VOL	17:04	Solidarity Across Borders: The Transnational Anti-Apartheid Movement	"This paper focuses on what from a global perspective must be seen as one of the most significant social movements during the post-war era: the transnational anti-apartheid movement. This movement lasted for more than three decades, from late 1950s to 1994, had a presence on all continents, and can be seen to be part of the construction of a global political culture during the Cold War. The paper argues that the history of the anti-apartheid struggle provides an important historical case for the analysis of present-day global politics especially in so far that movement organizations, action forms, and networks that were formed and developed in the anti-apartheid struggle are present in the contemporary context of the mobilization of a global civil society in relation to neoliberal globalization and supra-national political institutions such as the World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund, and World Bank."
913	2006	VOL	17:04	Global Civil Society and Its Discontents	"According to enthusiasts the concept of global civil society is spreading rapidly and becoming pivotal to the reconfiguring of the statist paradigm. However, critics have recently grown more numerous and outspoken in opposition to the term claiming that it is actually perpetuating statism by grafting the idea of civil society onto the global by way of an unhelpful domestic analogy. This paper examines the role the concept is playing in perpetuating/reconfiguring statism. First it summarizes current criticism by identifying three basic accusations: the ambiguity of the term, the domestic fallacy, and the undemocratic effects of using it. Second, these criticisms are considered in turn and it is concluded that all three points relate, ultimately, back to the failure of the critics themselves and some global civil society theorists to move beyond a state-centered framework of interpretation. In the final section it is shown how global civil society discourse is beginning to move not only the concept of civil society away from its state-centered historical meanings, but also how it is contributing to changing the content of the concept of the global."
914	2006	VOL	17:04	Global Civil Society: Royal Road or Slippery Path?	"Global civil society has become an important paradigm for progressive social change at a planetary level. It posits a bold new ethical project for global democratization. For its critics, though, it is just the social wing of neoliberal globalization diverting social movements from their tasks. It is also seen as irredeemably Eurocentric in its assumptions and orientation. A third option, proposed here, is to understand global civil society as a complex social and spatial terrain. By bringing politics back in, a progressive option can be presented to contest the dominant co-optive or reformist conception of global civil society."
915	2006	VOL	17:04	"Gramsci, Hegemony, and Global Civil Society Networks"	"This study offers a first empirical test at a truly global level of two contradictory models of global civil society in the global governance system that are put forth by neo-Gramscian thought. The first model posits that global civil society is coopted by hegemonic capitalist and political elites, and promotes hegemonic interests by distributing neoliberal values and providing a facade of opposition. The second model views global civil society as the infrastructure from which counter-hegemonic resistance, and ultimately a counter-hegemonic historic bloc will evolve and challenge neoliberal hegemony. The predictions that these two views make as to the structure of global civil society networks are tested through network analysis of a matrix of links between 10,001 international NGOs in a purposive sample of INGOs extracted from the database of the Union of International Associations. The findings provide partial support to the predictions of both models, and lead to the conclusion that at present global civil society is in a transitional phase, but that the current infrastructure provided by the global INGOs network is conducive to the development of a counter-hegemonic historic bloc in the future, providing the northern bias in network is decreased. Strategic steps needed to achieve this are presented."
916	2006	VOL	17:04	Global Civil Society and the Question of Global Citizenship	"For many recent commentators, the association of citizenship with the nation-state is under siege, as transnational and even global forms of citizenship begin to emerge. The nascent phenomenon of global citizenship in particular is characterized by three components: the global discourse on human rights, a global account of citizenly responsibilities, and finally global civil society. This last component is supposed to give a new global citizenship its political character, and for many represents the most likely vehicle for the emergence of a global, democratic citizen politics. This paper critically examines this view, asking whether a global form of citizenship is indeed emerging, and if so whether global civil society is well-equipped to stand in as its political dimension. The paper examines two opposed narratives on the potential of global civil society to form a political arm of global citizenship, before returning by way of conclusion to the vexed notion of global citizenship itself."

The standpoints can be termed Global justice movements, Third World nationalism, and the Post-Washington Consensus. These three perspectives stand in contrast to the fusion of neoliberal economics and neoconservative politics that dominates the contemporary world. The three approaches sometimes converge, but more often than not they are in conflict, as are the civil society institutions that cohere to the three different political ideologies. From the three different analyses flow different strategies, concrete campaigning tactics, and varying choices of allies. The World Social Forum provides hints of a potentially unifying approach within the global justice movements based upon the practical themes of decommodification and deglobalization (of capital). It is, however, only by facing up to the ideological divergences that the global justice movement can enhance its presence."

Behind this call for an assessment is the very nature of the debate and emerging gaps and weaknesses that together produce a potential slow-down in generating new knowledge and understanding of global civil society. There are several shortcomings to the current research approach: the failure to take account of other civil society traditions, the failure to address the relationship between global civil society, conflict, and violence, and, most critically, the neglect of the notion of civility, both conceptually and empirically. The balance of the paper then explores the implications of this new assessment of global civil society research."

Enhancing the potential of youth serving organizations is vital as many of these small groups lack infrastructure and resources. One organization has gone beyond grant making to organizations to include providing technical assistance, then moving to a model of capacity building to improve their ability to fulfill their mission. This paper describes the efforts of New Detroit to improve the infrastructure of youth serving grassroots organizations through a multi-faceted model and the outcomes evidenced from the first cohort. In addition we explore the contradictions inherent in working with small groups. How do you improve effectiveness without destroying the homegrown character these groups possess? The model presented here shows the value of empowering small grassroots groups to build capacity."

The conceptual framework for explaining those responses was the ecological approach to the study of human development. In that context, the paper deals with the combined contribution of two ecological systems the ontogenic system and the microsystem. The ontogenic system included sociodemographic variables (gender and religiosity), as well as empowerment resources. The microsystem included variables related to family context (parental volunteer activity and family support for volunteering), as well as to the context of volunteer activity (perceived rewards, difficulties with volunteering, and professional supervision). Sociodemographic variables and difficulties in relations with the provider organization predicted burnout, whereas rewards and professional supervision predicted satisfaction with volunteering. Empowerment contributed most to explaining volunteers' perceived contribution to the beneficiaries of services."
921	2007	VOL	18:01	Reporting Volunteer Labor at the Organizational Level: A Study of Canadian Nonprofits	"Volunteer contributions in the production of services are an important resource internationally. However, few countries include volunteer contributions in their national accounts, even though many encourage their populations to engage in volunteering. At the organizational level, many nonprofit organizations using volunteers often limit their input to a footnote in annual reports acknowledging their contribution, few estimate their value in financial terms. As a result, their financial accounts lack information upon which to base decisions affecting the organizations and the communities they serve. Additional information is required to assess the impact of volunteers in individual nonprofits as well as the sector as a whole. This study focuses on Canada, one of the few countries that include volunteers in the national accounts, to examine to what extent nonprofit organizations estimate a financial value for these contributions and include this in their financial statements. This paper reports the results of an online survey of 661 nonprofits from across Canada. In order to understand why some organizations keep records for volunteer contributions and quantify them, two sets of explanatory factors are explored: organizational characteristics and the attitude of the executive director. We find larger organizations were more likely to engage in record keeping and estimating volunteer value, as were organizations with a relatively large group of volunteers and volunteer programs. The attitude of the executive director is important in determining which organizations engage in these practices."

The Value of Paid and Unpaid Work for Flemish Red Cross Volunteers	"This paper considers the current debate on the changing position and meaning of paid work in Western societies. In the wake of a structural crisis of fulltime employment, a new role and potential is attributed to voluntary work. With data drawn from a survey of Red Cross volunteers in Flanders (Belgium), this research assesses empirically the value volunteers attach to paid and unpaid work and their disposition to combine paid and unpaid work more flexibly. Contrary to current theorizing about the advent of a brave new world of work, this study provides evidence for a continuing existence of strong paid work orientations, even among a population that actually performs unpaid work. Moreover, it is not the economic (dis)embedding of volunteers, but the extent and nature of their social participation that primarily explains the strength of paid work orientation and the propensity to tailor paid work more flexibly to volunteer work."

A History of Measurement in the British Voluntary Sector	"Over the last two decades, nonprofit organizations in the United Kingdom (UK) have faced increased pressure to measure their activities in order to demonstrate their competency, to achieve legitimacy, and to obtain funding. This paper draws from recent literature in the sociology of science to examine quantification in the British voluntary sector as a historically situated and socially constructed process. Using archival and secondary documents, I find that quantification is not a new practice for charities in the UK, moreover, while they have employed metrication in the past, what activities nonprofits have measured, and the importance of measurement for their organizational success, has altered over the course of the century."

Based on participant observation and open ended interviews, this paper describes the origins, development, and evaluation of Poverty Zero in Andalusia (Spain). It examines, by means of ethnography, how DNGOs (Development Nongovernmental Organizations) create social movement networks, and explores the limits and possibilities of their advocacy activities. The paper concludes that DNGOs tend to generate centralized social movements with reduced questioning of the global system. Nevertheless, as shown in the case of the Andalusian Alliance against Poverty, the more decentralized a movement, the deeper its transformational potential."

Psychographic Heterogeneity Among Volunteers in Australia	"Six psychographic segments of volunteers in Australia are constructed on the basis of their volunteering motivations. The resulting segments include classic volunteers, whose motivations are threefold: doing something worthwhile, personal satisfaction, and helping others. Dedicated volunteers perceive each one of the motives for volunteering as relevant, while personally involved volunteers donate time because of someone they know in the organization, most likely their child. Volunteers for personal satisfaction and altruists primarily wish to help others, and finally, niche volunteers typically have fewer and more specific drivers motivating them to donate time, for example, to gain work experience. The segments are externally validated and demonstrate significantly different socio-demographic profiles. Consequently, it seems that motivation-based data-driven market segmentation represents a useful way of gaining insight into heterogeneity amongst volunteers. Such insight can be used by volunteering organizations to more effectively target segments with customized messages."

Child welfare nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in Romania are used as a case study for examining the issue. The paper begins with a discussion of NGO-government partnerships in service provision in international development, and examines the ethical concerns surrounding church-state separation as applied to nonprofits in the United States and in the context of foreign aid. The literature analysis is complimented by empirical evidence from the Romanian case, using data gathered in a qualitative study exploring the role of NGOs as social service providers and policy advocates. The paper concludes by discussing the particular role that bureaucratic discretion and power plays in protecting the freedom of association rights of clientele in Romania."

Existing theoretical models emphasize the importance of the employee's motivation and output control for the effectiveness of PfP-systems. However, empirical evidence on which factors influence PfP-system's introduction in NPOs is still lacking. Based on an exploratory study of nine Austrian NPOs, this paper develops hypotheses on what organizational factors distinguish NPOs that rely on PfP-systems for managing employees' performance differences from those that use alternative approaches (e.g., job enrichment, NPO-spirit). Findings suggest that decisions on the application of PfP-systems are influenced by five determinants: perceived degree of competitiveness regarding funding and service provision, degree of strategic freedom, clarity of strategic objectives, existence of management instruments, and organizational culture."

Many learned for the first time, for example, that the federal government is a secondary responder and attends to natural disasters only when states and localities request such support and assistance. That U.S. framework and the international relief implementation structure are remarkably similar. This paper compares and contrasts these two aid implementation approaches with an eye to clarifying their similarities and differences and to identifying how each might better be understood for the future to secure improved coordination and more effective outcomes."

There are concerns within the sector about the implications for citizenship and participation. The sector is highly dependent on volunteers yet little is known about how organizational change in response to new relationships with the statutory sector impact upon the commitment and well-being of people who volunteer. This paper addresses that gap in knowledge for older volunteers. Drawing upon collaborative research with a voluntary organization in the north of England, the authors explore the meanings and aspirations of volunteering for older people, and explain how and why changes associated with closer engagement with public service delivery and less grant dependency can be disempowering for them."
930	2007	VOL	18:03	The Deployment of Partnerships by the Voluntary Sector to Address Service Needs in Rural and Small Town Canada	"Service restructuring trends since the 1980s have resulted in the downsizing or closure of many services in rural and small town Canada. In response, voluntary groups have been filling some of the emerging service gaps. Services, however, often are directed at complex problems that demand information, support, or assistance from a range of sources and institutions. For voluntary groups, this underscores a need to partner with other groups, organizations, or service providers. At the same time, voluntary organizations are increasingly encouraged to develop partnerships with public or private partners in order to qualify for government funding. This study tracks 29 voluntary organizations in four rural and small town places across Canada to explore the development and maintenance of partnerships (both local and non-local), as well as the types of networks, resources, and expertise for which partnerships were used. The findings indicate that while voluntary organizations feel that local partnerships are more important, partnerships with groups outside of these places are equally developed. Partnerships were used to expand networks, obtain expertise, and access a range of resources to assist in daily operations and delivery of services. The increase in partnerships with groups outside of these communities, particularly with non-local service providers, will have important implications for voluntary organizations and policy makers."

The mineral resources and mining history of Montana are discussed, as is the vibrant civil society of that state. Montana's civil society has opposed mining due to its environmental effects, particularly upon areas of high conservation value. This opposition has involved litigation and the implementation of a ban on the use of cyanide by the mining industry. The paper concludes with a discussion of whether this opposition to mining has damaged the economy of the state and Montana's future as an example of the New West, wherein amenities based growth act as the principal agent of economic activity."

In order to do so, they studied relationships in eight different fields of activity: homeless youth services, housing for intellectually deficient people, support organizations for natural caregivers, community leisure centers, community housing for the elderly, daycare centers, social economy organizations for domestic assistance, and services specializing in employment for handicapped people. Following a review of international literature on the relationship between the government and the third sector, the paper analyzes these relationships on the basis of the typology developed by Jennifer M. Coston, which is adapted to the Quebecois context. In the eight activity sectors studied, the authors found the presence of four different types of interface between the government and the third sector: subcontracting, coexistence, supplementarity, and co-construction relationships."

The NGOs represent a diversity of political access, financial resources, and international connections. Three campaign activities common to both countries undertaken between 2004 and 2006 are analyzed for their effectiveness via interviews and document review. This examination is embedded within an analysis of the political, economic, policy, and social contexts of each country. It is shown that in the UK climate change has been used as a pivotal leadership issue, that the fossil fuel industry's influence is not predominant, and that NGOs enjoy political legitimacy. Whereas, in Australia climate change has only recently emerged as a political priority, the fossil fuel industry has had significant political and financial influence, and NGO advocacy has been marginalized. It is argued that NGOs are embedded in the political and policy contexts of their country, and the greatest campaign traction and NGO influence can only be achieved when these contexts provide favorable conditions."

Previous research shows inconsistent findings regarding both the effect of income on the probability of giving and the proportion of income spent on charitable giving. We test hypotheses with the Giving in The Netherlands Panel Study 2003 (N = 1,316). We do not find an effect of income on the probability of giving, but a consistent negative effect of income on both total and religious donations as a proportion of income. This effect cannot be explained by stronger religious affiliation of lower income groups, or by other differences such as age, and price of giving. We find evidence in favor of a giving standard: Norms concerning the level of donations in specific situations that people in different income groups share, leading lower income groups to donate a higher proportion of their income."

Recent critical approaches to the concept have questioned the tendency to view civil society as an unequivocal good, yet the majority of these critiques still focus on civil society at a global level or on the enabling and disabling capacity of the state at the national level. This paper argues that civil society is constrained not only by the state but by local government and other actors from within civil society. Identity politics, power relations, and existing inequalities between and within communities affect the ability of formal and informal organizations to contest the causes of insecurity. This paper examines the role of civil society in addressing gender-based insecurity in the Indian state of Meghalaya to demonstrate the influence of these factors on civil society and concludes by arguing that civil society is a much more dynamic and contradictory sphere than is often recognized by both advocates and critics. These dynamics must be understood if the constraints on civil society are to be transcended."

Despite persistent argumentation in this debate that voluntary associations are of crucial importance in this process, empirical research usually reveals but a weak relation between membership and democratic (or civic) attitudes. In this paper, we follow recent arguments that various types of associations may play different roles. Specifically, we empirically distinguish between bridging and bonding associations based on the socioeconomic diversity within an association. Using a dataset on association membership in Flanders, we find empirical support for the view that individuals' values and attitudes indeed differ across members in (predominantly) bridging or bonding associations."

Similarly, it was thought that social science students are the most involved in voluntary action, with students of natural sciences and humanities in the middle. However, there were very few studies that empirically compared these assertions. Furthermore, these assertions were not investigated from cross-cultural perspectives. Based on a study of students in 12 countries (N = 6,570), we found that even when controlling for background variables, social science students are actually less engaged in voluntary action than other students. Engineering students are higher than expected on voluntary action while students of humanities are the most involved in voluntary action. When studying these differences in the 12 selected countries, local cultures and norms form different sets of findings that suggest that there is no universal trend in choice of academic field and voluntary action."
938	2008	VOL	19:01	"Social Capital, Volunteering, and Charitable Giving"	"This paper explores the impact of social capital measured by social trust and social networks on individual charitable giving to religious and secular organizations. Using United States data from the national sample of the 2000 Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey, we find that social trust, bridging social network, and civic engagement increase the amount of giving to both religious and secular causes. In contrast, organizational activism only affects secular giving. Volunteering activity, and human and financial capital indicators positively affect both religious and secular giving. Finally, those who are happy about their lives and those who are religious give more to religious causes, but these factors do not affect secular giving. We find evidence of important differences in the determinants of religious and secular giving, suggesting the need to distinguish these two types of charitable giving in future work."

Research on persuasive advertising and the arousal: cost-reward model serve as theoretical foundations. The results of two experiments indicate that advertisement-induced (ad-induced) emotional arousal, message framing, and manipulations of self-efficacy perceptions can impact willingness to volunteer. Analysis detected a significant interaction between perceived self-efficacy and message framing. In the low (high) self-efficacy condition gain frames (loss frames) were more persuasive. When gender-related differences were considered, analysis revealed that ad-induced emotional arousal and manipulations of self-efficacy had their impact solely on men's willingness to volunteer. Based on the results of the empirical analyses, implications for management and starting points for future research are presented."

Using random samples of nonprofits drawn from the two organizational populations, the analysis compares the extent of structural resemblance or isomorphism in each. It detects similar levels of isomorphism for several structural characteristics. The paper interprets this finding as reflecting expectations for nonprofit organizations that stretch worldwide."

The last result generally derives from the focus on mean amount given. This article examines gender differences in giving focusing on the distribution of amounts donated and the probability of giving using micro-data on individual giving to charitable causes for Great Britain. Results indicate that women are generally more generous than men also in terms of the amounts donated. Quantile regression analysis shows that this pattern is robust if we take into account gender differences in individual characteristics such as household structure, education, and income. The article also investigates differences in gender preferences for varying charitable causes. Results are presented separately for single and married people, highlighting the very different gender patterns of giving behavior found in the two groups."
942	2008	VOL	19:02	"The Give and Take of Volunteering: Motives, Benefits, and Personal Connections among Irish Volunteers"	"Volunteers are integral to the delivery of health and social services in many countries. Volunteer motivation is the key phenomenon around which research into the psychology of volunteering behavior has been based in the recent past. This study comprised interviews with 26 volunteers working with eight health and social care organizations in Ireland. The study aimed to describe and interpret reasons for initial and continued volunteering involvement. Four key themes were proposed on the basis of a thematic analysis: volunteer motives, personal connections to organizations and causes, benefits, and challenges arising from volunteering. These themes are analyzed in light of social psychological theory to better understand why people volunteer and maintain their involvement in the face of competing demands. The findings suggest that benefits and challenges merit a higher profile in research into the volunteer process, and that bonds of perceived obligation motivate many volunteers to begin and continue their involvement in health and social care."

To identify the relationship between collaboration with the state and civic autonomy we draw on data from a survey of 740 Hungarian regional civic associations. We did not find support for the theses that mixing with the state might undermine the autonomy of COs and lead to their political neutralization. Also, we did not find support for the hypotheses that political action is solely about money or it is the property of non-autonomous NGOs. We have identified several mechanisms that allow COs to combine participation in partnership projects with maintained autonomy and political activism."

The article shows how legislative practices of democratic states serve to reduce foreign influence. Issue characteristics are also shown to determine state response to externalization, blocking transnational ties in high politics areas such as minority claims. Finally, within state imposed restrictions, religious rather than secular organizations remain dominant transnational actors in India. The study contributes evidence to suggest that contrary to the arguments of world polity theory and many transnational social movement scholars, states continue to remain powerful actors limiting trans nationalization."
945	2008	VOL	19:02	Social Movements and Rights Claims: The Case of Action Groups in the Niger Delta of Nigeria	"This article examines how the various claims to, and demands for, rights have enabled and shaped the various equity and justice seeking social movements that have emerged in the Niger Delta of Nigeria, the key point being that claims to rights are fundamental of the logic and coherence of social movements. The article is divided into three sections. The first sets the conceptual and analytical frame by elaborating on the rights social movements nexus. This is followed by a discussion of the historical and conceptual location of the Niger Delta. The rest of the article interrogates the contexts of relative deprivation, rights denial, and injustice within which social movements have emerged in the Niger Delta. A major objective is to account for why the social movements have been largely ethnic and most recently generational and to analyze the dynamics and outcomes of the rights struggles waged by the various social movements."

In this context, the analysis of new and innovative forms of philanthropy is paramount. This paper focuses on an innovation in the philanthropic form: the community foundation. The success of community foundations in the United States provided the impetus for the establishment of community foundations in the UK in the 1980s. This paper examines how the community foundation form has been adapted to the UK and the factors which have influenced the development and roles of British community foundations. It is argued that this study is both timely and important for three reasons. First, the analysis of new structures through which people give furthers our understanding of Britain's culture of giving. Second, the paper examines the role of community-based philanthropy in the civil renewal of Britain's communities. Finally, the study makes an important contribution to efforts to promote the community foundation form worldwide as it highlights the challenges of transferring philanthropic forms from one context to another."

Grounded in a post-colonial understanding of urban educated upper and middle class women NGO volunteers in contemporary India, it analyzes how they negotiate new approaches to challenge existing traditional gender roles, yet in critical ways contribute to their reproduction, particularly the traditional concept of ideal Indian womanhood. Employing structural ritualization theory we examine how ritualized symbolic practices related to the traditional concepts of caretaking, sacrifice, and the concept of natural sexual differences continue to be emphasized in a generation confronted with conflicting expectations about modern women's roles. Twenty-one testimonies provide the major source of evidence along with data gathered through participant observation. This research enhances our understanding of the power of rituals and how they can continue to shape the cognitions and activities of actors."
948	2008	VOL	19:03	Marketing of Voluntary Organizations as Contract Providers of National and Local Government Welfare Services in the UK	"Voluntary organizations have become major providers of numerous social welfare services that previously were supplied by the state. In Britain, between 35 and 40% of the average human services charity's annual income now derives from government (predominantly local government) sources, meaning that the acquisition of fresh contracts to undertake government funded work, in conjunction with the maintenance of good relations with government funders vis-ö-vis current assignments, is increasingly important for ensuring a human service charity's financial survival. An organization that wishes to obtain new contracts and to keep government bodies satisfied with its present activities will need to market itself effectively. This empirical study examined two aspects of charity marketing relevant to this requirement: the extent to which voluntary organizations applied the principles of strategic account management (otherwise known as key account management) to their relations with government funders, and the organizational characteristics (passion and commitment, low wage costs, etc.) that they emphasized to government bodies when making bids. A number of organizational variables (e.g., mission rigidity, strategic intent, short term operational focus) were employed in regression analyses as possible determinants of: (i) the degree to which a charity used strategic account management, and (ii) the genres of the organizational characteristics that it accentuated when tendering for government funded work."
949	2008	VOL	19:03	From Market to State Networking: The Case of a Norwegian Voluntary Organization	"The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate and explain how a Norwegian voluntary, faith-based organization the Gospel Centre of Norway (Pinsevennenes Evangeliesenter)successfully substituted a network for market strategy vis-ö-vis the public sector in order to obtain organizational legitimacy and financial security. During the first decade of its existence it obtained a unique position in its relationship with the state, as a separate item in the budget of the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs. The organization operates in the field of substance abuse rehabilitation, i.e., in a situation where instrumental effectiveness is difficult to assess. In such a situation ritual or other institutional criteria may replace effectiveness criteria and impression management is shown to be a successful strategy. Attention is paid to the relevant environmental conditions under which this organizational change of strategy was successful."

Guatemala's mineral resources, and government efforts to encourage their extraction, are discussed, as is the emergent civil society of that nation. Guatemalan civil society has opposed mining due to the impacts of its environmental effects upon the poor engaged in subsistence agriculture. This opposition has involved protests, community consultations against mining, and networking with the forces of global civil society. The paper concludes with a discussion of how this opposition to mining is a manifestation of the opposition to neoliberalism currently underway in Latin America."
951	2008	VOL	19:04	The Decoupling of Organizational Society: The Case of Norwegian Voluntary Organizations	"The means, motives, and opportunity of cooperation must be present if organizations are to establish mutual ties. Public benefit and conflict oriented organizations are hypothesized to have stronger motives for cooperation than member benefit and consensus oriented groups, and organizations with broad activity scope are likely to face more opportunities of cooperation than specialized organizations. These hypotheses are strengthened by results from regression analyses. The article further shows a historical decline in both the motives and opportunities for such cooperation in the case of Norway through processes of depoliticization, individualization, and specialization. Thus, here, the preconditions for cooperation within organizational society are gradually deteriorating. Such developments are likely to weaken the interconnectedness of voluntary organizations and the potential micro, meso, and macro benefits of such ties."

"This article asks whether French NGOs have fallen into line with the wider trend towards professionalization that has marked the Northern nonprofit sector, most notably Anglo-American NGOs, over the last two decades or so. It shows how French NGOs, particularly those engaged in longer term development work, were characterized by militancy over the early post-colonial decades. It then demonstrates how, over the global era, the French state has encouraged developmental NGOs (NGDOs) to undertake bureaucratic forms of professionalization. Next, it looks at how these organizations have, in response, adapted their staffing, structures, and procedures, whilst stopping short of overly standardized forms of development. Finally, it shows how French NGDOs have, in eschewing technical professionalism, been acting in line with resource dependence theory and responding to the demands of their critical resource, which is not the French state but the donor public and their grassroots supporters."
953	2008	VOL	19:04	Effects of International Volunteering and Service: Individual and Institutional Predictors	"Despite unprecedented recent expansion of international volunteering and service (IVS), there has been relatively little research on impacts. This paper proposes a conceptual model for impact research based on existing research evidence published in English. The model suggests that outcomes for host communities, volunteers, and sending communities vary depending on individual and institutional attributes and capacity. How institutions structure and leverage individual capacity influences who participates and how they serve, and shapes the impact of volunteer action. The conceptual model provides directions for future research."
954	2009	VOL	20:01	"Theorists have linked the creation of social capital to the development of the kind of robust civil society that underwrites the well formed and stable democracy. This understanding raises the problem of what is social capital in specific national contexts. A critical issue is whether and to what extent a model of social capital molded to the EuroAmerican experience is applicable to the new democracies. Three arguments are made in the context of a review of the works of Putnam and Touraine. First, the question of social capital foundationally concerns not only the production of institutions and values but the conditions of production. Analysis thus needs to grasp not only the specifically social process of its creation, distribution, and institutionalization, but the political culture and economy that serve as its foundation. Second, theories of social capital created in the context of nation-state based production-centered political economy do not capture what is going on in an increasingly globalized and circulatory political economy. And third, theories of social capital centered on the United States and Europe are only partially applicable to the emerging democracies of Africa and the post-colony generally."

Using the example of healthcare, the paper problematizes the widespread move towards an increased reliance on voluntary and third sector provision. Drawing on literature around women's community activism, the research considers the extent to which women carrying out health promotion work in Peru have taken on this role as more than just voluntary work, highlighting their long term commitment during more than a decade of health promotion activities. The paper develops debates around the professionalization of voluntary work, particularly considering the issue of economic remuneration for health promoters, and emphasizing the gendered nature of their voluntarism, concluding by questioning the sustainability of poor women's long term, and largely unpaid, involvement as the linchpins of community development projects."
956	2009	VOL	20:01	Doomed to Extinction? The Nature and Future of Volunteering for Meals-on-Wheels Services	"Meals-on-wheels services in Ireland and elsewhere rely heavily on volunteers to operate. Meals-on-wheels services that draw extensively on volunteers' contributions both benefit from and augment social capital within communities. Based on interviews with voluntary and paid meals-on-wheels coordinators and staff carried out in early 2007, this article examines: (1) the recruitment and retention of volunteers, (2) motivations for volunteering, (3) the nature of the contributions of volunteers, and, (4) the future role of volunteering within the service. The article argues that volunteerism in meals provision for older adults in Ireland is in crisis. The recruitment and retention of volunteers may be improved if service providers gain a better understanding of the motivations of volunteers and develop strategies to ensure that volunteers have an opportunity to engage in work that corresponds to their original motivations, which includes enhancing the social capital of their communities."

In theory, as market demand for a product or service increases, the business attracts more interest from local elites, to whom all the benefits tend to go in the end. However, the two cases suggest feasible ways for the poor with intermediary to open up a business opportunity in the elite-controlled rural economy: market differentiation and the use of a stagnant industry. As a result, new NGO elite relations emerge. Considering the limited life of such relations, efforts should be concentrated on enabling the poor to make the most of the business opportunity in the short term under the new NGO elite relations."
958	2009	VOL	20:01	Values and the Legitimacy of Third Sector Service Delivery Organizations: Evidence from Australia	"The values espoused by third sector service delivery organizations form the basis of normative claims of legitimacy. Such claims are subject to on-going debate with critics arguing that third sector service delivery organizations do not truly represent the views of those they are trying to assist or that they often fail to institutionalize their values in their relationships with service users. Using instrumental case studies of six social welfare programs in three cities in Australia, this article explores questions of legitimacy by examining whether organizational values were the same as those of service users and whether this matters in terms of services having a positive impact on service users. While research findings generally support normative claims of legitimacy, instrumental values were found to be more important than underlying ethical values or outcome values in generating positive outcomes for service users. However it is these instrumental values that are most at risk from overly prescriptive funding mechanisms."

Pro-migrant NGOs are majority community-led and face a challenging political and societal context for mobilization including a restrictive immigration regime, political and media discourse that racializes migrants, weak public support for the expansion of migrants' rights, and high rates of discrimination and social exclusion experienced by migrant communities. A competitive funding environment also inhibits pro-migrant NGOs capacity to work with emerging migrant-led organizations that simultaneously compete for state and foundation funds. Pro-migrant NGOs in Ireland have responded with a three leveled strategy, namely alliance building with sympathetic public officials and service and information provision to state bodies, campaigns contesting negative media and societal framing of migrants, and networking with transnational NGO coalitions working on immigration issues."
960	2009	VOL	20:02	Portrait of the Social Entrepreneur: Statistical Evidence from a US Panel	"Social entrepreneurship is an increasingly important concept in the study of voluntary and nonprofit organizations. In spite of the growing recognition of this concept, little is known about what individual characteristics might describe or explain who in society is likely to be (or become) a social entrepreneur. This preliminary study empirically addresses this question using data from a United States online panel. Our results suggest that social entrepreneurs are likely to be female, non-white, younger, and college-educated individuals with some business experience and who live in big cities. Social entrepreneurs also tend to have more social capital, as measured by their activity in clubs and organizations other than work, and they are more likely to be happy, interested in politics, extroverted, giving (to charity), and liberal ideologically. Although exploratory, these findings help describe the social entrepreneur and suggest ways in which this important actor in civil society can be better identified, understood, and perhaps cultivated."

We use a political process model, which is based on favorable political opportunities, cognitive liberation, and indigenous organizational strength, to explain the sharp growth in citizen organized ENGOs. In addition, we employ a world society perspective to help clarify why the political environment in China became favorable for ENGO growth, and how international ENGO practices were diffused within China. Our analysis shows that the relatively high status of ENGO founders together with their personal and professional networks also played important roles in ENGO growth."

Using a best practices Canadian case study approach, this research describes an alternative approach to volunteer engagement that emphasizes lifestyle integration, organizational informality and flexibility, and volunteer agency collaboration. We suggest that traditional volunteer management structures may actually be hindering engagement and call instead for a more vocation-based, networked, and collaborative approach which affords greater autonomy to the volunteer and sees power being shared between agencies and volunteers."

This paper argues that this sector is small in terms of membership, voluntary performance, beneficiaries, and budget. Nonprofit organizations have succeeded in developing close relationships with local communities, as well as in providing essential alleviation quickly and flexibly. On the other hand, organizations are very dependent on the state and they keep beneficiaries away from decision making, moreover, their contribution to building social capital is trivial and participation in policy-making minimal. The lack of collective representation prevents an open society and hinders communication with government."
964	2009	VOL	20:03	Civicness: From Civil Society to Civic Services?	"Activities in civil society, seen as the sphere of society in which voluntary associations are dominant, are considered an important source of civility in modern society. By interacting and finding solutions for common problems, members of associations turn into citizens with a broader perspective and interest in the common good. The evidence for these positive roles is at best mixed, however. Not voluntarily associating in a separate sphere of civil society, but combining associational with public and commercial modes of social coordination, appears to offer a more promising option for civilizing modern society. Examples of hybridity are discussed. The paper concludes with a plea for a clearer recognition in social research of civicness as a normative perspective."
965	2009	VOL	20:03	Civicness and Civility: Their Meanings for Social Services	"Civicness and civility are discussed as intertwined notions. To the degree they flourish, societies can be seen as civil societies. Providing some reflection on them may make a difference to the usual civil society and third sector debates. These concepts are not based on or confined to a specific sector like the third sector, basically all social sectors can contribute to and be marked by them, depending on their constellations and interplay. Therefore, a mediating public sphere and democratic governance have a key role to play. However, beyond an overlapping consensus, civicness and civility can mean different things and the dominant meanings change over time. This is discussed with respect to changing discourses on welfare as they have crystallized in the field of social services. Despite the contested meanings of civility and civicness shown here, introducing these points of reference could help to enrich concerns with the quality and overall designs of personal services in a civil society."

The civicness of organizations expresses itself in how they enable positive interaction over such conflicts between their members. This paper focuses specifically on the relationship between professionals and their managers. By infusing social behavior with civil values, organizations can contribute to a wider culture of citizenship."

The empirical analysis is structured around the concept of governance regime. The paper shows that modernization processes within the field of social services in Europe develop along two radically different regulative conceptions reflected into two different governance regimes: market-based or competitive governance vs. civic-based or partnership governance. The governance of social services in Europe appears to take place within a mix between two ideal-typical governance regimes: the market-based and partnership-based governance regimes.

Based on a long-term ethnography of youth programs in the United States, this paper shows that entities like these, which participants and researchers alike often called volunteer or civic groups, operate very differently from traditional civic groups. The ethnography systematically details prevalent tensions that actors face when they try to cultivate the civic spirit in these increasingly typical organizations."

Christian principles and missionary efforts are central in the development of humanitarianism, and the agencies associated with the Christian tradition comprise a prominent and growing portion of international humanitarian agencies. Little, however, is known about how Christian faith-based agencies diverge from one another in their orientation and operations, how their theological tradition shapes their humanitarianism, and whether or how they are distinct from secular agencies. Examining the humanitarianism of Christian faith-based agencies in light of their theological roots, this article delineates three classifications of Christian faith-based agencies: Accommodative Humanitarian, Synthesis Humanitarian, and Evangelistic Humanitarian agencies. The study demonstrates the importance of distinguishing not simply between faith-based and secular agencies, but among faith-based agencies themselves."

Based on a survey with 186 direct participants in the foreign exchange program and 608 schoolmates at 126 secondary schools, a detailed analysis is made of differences in knowledge, attitudes, and behavior with respect to international cooperation, and tolerance regarding ethnic minorities. To guarantee unbiased impact assessment, the same data is collected among 276 students of a comparison group. Propensity score-matching techniques are used for data analysis, controlling for intrinsic differences among the three groups. Results show that international exchange programs have a significant positive impact on all four dimensions of societal support of the direct participants compared to their schoolmates. Only knowledge and attitudes changes are registered in the scores of the schoolmates compared to the comparison group. These outcomes remain robust when corrected for individual and school characteristics, parental background, and political preferences, and when unobserved heterogeneity is included."

These are understood within the theoretical framework of the psychological contract. Results show the distinctive contribution volunteers can make to events but also the distinctive challenges they present to event managers. For event managers, volunteers bring: enthusiasm, a good relationship and empathy with the public, and they provide a cheaper labor force. But a major concern is ensuring their reliability. For volunteers, important expectations include: flexibility of engagement, the quality of personal relationships, recognition for their contribution, and a clear communication of what they are expected to do. The juxtaposition of event manager and volunteer perspectives illustrates the need for a different approach to managing volunteers in comparison to paid employees. This reflects both volunteers' expectations and the recognition that they have greater autonomy, not being tied to a contract by financial rewards or a related career progression. More generally the results illustrate the use of the theoretical framework provided by the psychological contract but that in using this it is valuable to compare the perspectives of managers and volunteers, using a qualitative approach to understand this social relationship."

There is an overall positive correlation between volunteering and perceived health, life satisfaction, and self-life expectancy and a negative correlation to depression. However, in some countries the correlation is much stronger than in others."

The volunteers work in a mutual aid, self-production, self-consumption system whose main purpose is identifying and nurturing high-level performers. But the new HMG/Sport England strategies leading to London 2012 expects volunteers to make a major contribution to sustaining and extending participation. The study utilized six focus group sessions with a total of 36 officials and members of 36 clubs across the six counties of Eastern England to assess whether and to what extent government policy objectives can be delivered through the voluntary sector. The study focused on the perceptions and attitudes of club members about being expected to serve public policy and the current pressures they and their clubs face. The results lead the authors to question the appropriateness, sensitivity, and feasibility of current sport policy, particularly the emphasis on VSCs as policy implementers."

The main explanation for this observation has been the lack of organizational vivacity in the past, either during the Communist regime or before it. More recently, however, some researchers, and especially those involved with area studies, have warned such a conclusion might be hasty and incorrect. The associational history of Bulgaria, a case that has not been much studied until now provides additional support in favor of the argument that pre-Communist associational life in the region has been abundant. The evidence provided in this paper comes from an original compilation of more than 100 organizations classified according to contemporary standards and from narratives on the most popular and populous organizations in the country since the nineteenth century."

It demonstrates that Colombian state institutions aim to foster culturally democratic citizens through decentralization initiatives and participation mechanisms at the local level. The National Culture Plan is an overarching national policy that intends to be a reference for governance and civil society participation looking particularly to the players involved in the provision and consumption of cultural activities for its implementation. It marks a change at the national level as it launches civil society into the formulation of cultural policies and political participation in general. By examining local nongovernmental organizations through document and qualitative analysis, the study identifies four types of nongovernmental organizations that self-identified as working in cultural activities in Bogotàinsiders, yearners, dismissers, and outsiders. These types of NGOs emerged in personal interviews and illustrate that NGO state relationships vary across the sector. Participation among the nongovernmental sector is uneven despite institutional reforms and initiatives supported by national legislation. This article provides data to add to a growing and innovative body of research necessary for professionals in public policy and nongovernmental management fields."

Corporatism may also be seen as a variety of democracy in which interest groups are integrated in the preparation and/or implementation of public policies. Departing in the last position, we measure the strength of Scandinavian corporatism by the involvement of interest groups in public committees, councils, and commissions. Corporatism in relation to the preparation of policy has gone down in all three Scandinavian countries whereas corporatism in implementation processes are more varied among the three countries."

The purpose of this article is to identify the kinds of activities that organizations in New South Wales and Queensland use to promote advocacy, the kinds of language that is used to describe these activities, and the reasons given for the particular strategies adopted. The extent to which the organizations adopt softer (that is more institutional forms of advocacy) rather than more openly challenging forms of activism is examined, particularly in light of a neo-liberal political and economic environment. In this analysis emergent strategies are identified that are not easily categorized as either institutional or radical advocacy. The article presents an exploratory analysis of some of the implications of the strategies adopted, in terms of their democratic effects and potential to strengthen the capacity of third sector organizations. The article is informed by the findings of a qualitative research project involving interviews with 24 organizations in the community services and environmental fields."

An enduring source of pressure on the US Government has been nonprofit campaigns operating at both a state and federal level. Six US environmental nonprofits representing a diversity of resources and prominence were selected for an in-depth examination of their climate-focused campaigns. Given the resistance at the federal level, these nonprofits have undertaken state-focused campaigns to achieve adequate climate policy development. This research examined some climate campaigns in California by the selected nonprofits that have supported, enhanced, and influenced the Californian Government's efforts to address climate change. The campaigns have gained leverage from existing state competition for economic advancement and political leadership on issues of public concern. In addition, they appear to have benefited from a high level of environmental awareness in the community, a history of progressive environmental legislation, Governor Schwarzenegger's use of climate change to differentiate his political leadership, and strong public trust of nonprofits. Recent climate-related political pledges and legislative changes at a federal level are convergent with the nonprofit-influenced, state-level developments."

Pursuing both a social mission and an explicitly economic rationale, this particular nonprofit organization provides an exemplary research setting for inquiring into the delicate and contradictory interplay of mission focus and commercial imperatives. Departing from the practice perspective as a micro-view on everyday strategizing an approach that seems to have not found its way into NPO-research yet allows us to take an in-depth look at how people go about the process of making strategy despite the tensions between mission and profit. Our data yields three patterns of strategizing practices that aim at fostering economic growth without damaging the social mission, namely supporting diverse positions, protecting stabilized relationships, and relating to organizational experiences. Building upon our empirical results, we tentatively conceptualize balancing practices as potentially important acts of strategizing in NPOs."

The impact of board characteristics on organizational performance is contextual. Specifically, we predict and show for a sample of U.S. nonprofits that board mechanisms related to monitoring are more likely to be effective for stable organizations, whereas board mechanisms related to boundary spanning are more effective for less stable organizations. We find that the two theories are complementary and address different aspects of nonprofit performance, but the results are statistically stronger and more often consistent with resource dependence than with agency theory. Overall, this study supports Miller-Millesen's (Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly, 32: 521 547 2003) contention that, because the nonprofit environment is often more complex and heterogeneous than the for-profit world, no one theory describes all tasks of nonprofit boards."

This study is designed in two distinct segments to be able to engage all formal and informal volunteering in Mexico. The first segment is the analysis of a nationwide survey which presents the main data and findings plus the analysis of these numbers. The second segment reveals some of the main motivations that individuals have for giving and for participating both within and outside of group settings. The national nature of this research project reveals interesting patterns of volunteerism and citizen action by gender, location, and motivation, plus various forms of solidary participation that may be useful guides in the prevailing need to build and strengthen civil society organizations in Mexico and in this region of the world. These results provide an informed basis for decision making in the government public policy arena and reveal distinct and diverse ways for established CSOs to promote and enable citizens for more effective participation in community issues (Butcher, Springer, 2010)."

Broadly defined as the use of market-based approaches to address social issues, social enterprise provides a business source of revenue for civil society organizations. However, within these broad parameters, world regions have come to identify different concepts and contexts with the social enterprise movement in their areas. Largely lacking in the social enterprise literature are explanations of what these regional differences are, and whether and how socioeconomic context may play a role in these variations. Drawing on social origins theory, recent social enterprise comparative research, and socioeconomic data, this article examines the different factors shaping social enterprise in seven regions and countries. It finds that variations in socioeconomic contexts appear to account for international differences in social enterprise. These findings have practical implications for the development and transfer of social enterprise internationally."

The government failure theory is represented in the major existing literature as providing a sound explanatory basis for an interesting characteristic of the nonprofit sector, that is, there is a large variability in nonprofit sector size from one place to another. Salamon et al. (Social origins of civil society: An overview, Working Papers of the Johns Hopkins Comparative Nonprofit Sector Project, 2000) examined this theory using the Johns Hopkins Comparative Nonprofit Sector Project (CNP) data set, and consequently rejected the government failure theory. However, by applying the panel analysis approach to the CNP data set, this article shows that the government failure theory should not have been so easily rejected."

Key findings are that effectiveness is not framed by ENGO staff in terms of sustainability-related outcomes of value, despite contextual reasons why this might be so. Instead, effectiveness is interpreted in terms of popularity and engagement with the public, with funders and with other key stakeholders. This suggests that despite organizational and population affirmations to the contrary, the environmental programs and activities are designed to engage human awareness and affect more than to create practical environmental change."
985	2010	VOL	21:02	Governing Civil Society: The Political Logic of NGO State Relations Under Dictatorship	"This paper attempts to take the first steps toward developing a theory of non-governmental organizations (NGO) state relations under dictatorship. Drawing on evidence from East Asia, the author argues that dictatorships typically employ one of two strategies in attempting to govern NGOs. First, some dictatorships follow a corporatist strategy, in which business associations, development, and social welfare organizations are co-opted into the state and controlled through a variety of strategies. Second, other dictatorships pursue an exclusionary strategy in which NGOs are marginalized and replaced with state institutions. Variation in the strategy chosen may be explained by differing levels of elite competition and the type of development strategy. Single-party states tend to regulate elite conflicts better and thus often choose corporatist strategies. In personalist regimes dictators tend to fear the organizational and mobilizational potential of NGOs and thus tend to pursue exclusionary strategies. This choice, however, is conditioned by the development strategy employed, as socialist development strategies reduce the incentives to allow NGOs."

Causes and Consequences of Personal Financial Management in the Case of Larger and Structural Charitable Donations	"We study causes and consequences of financial management in households in the specific case of charitable giving. We test hypotheses using couples in the Giving in the Netherlands Panel Study (n = 1,101). We find that more relationship specific investments lead to deciding on charitable giving as one economic actor. Furthermore, we find that the partner with the highest relative educational resources has most decision making power over charitable donations. Separately deciding couples are smallest charitable donors. Households in which the male partner decides are largest charitable donors when only larger and more structural donations are considered. This can be explained by their more conservative religious denomination."

It explores the attempt by a citizens' movement (CMDP) in Nepal to construct new political realities in the context of the autocratic regime of king Gyanendra and then during the democratic transition. This was, paradoxically, to be achieved through the construction of an apolitical space. Theoretically, this production of apoliticality by civil society actors shows that civil society is not only implicated in the expansion of what is understood as 'political' but also in setting its boundaries. The broader aims of the article are to contribute to the ethnography of civil society and to add to current understandings of the relationship of actually existing civil societies to the political domain. Practically, it argues that debates over whether civil society is or is not political in the Nepal case and normative positions within development circles that it should not be political are misconceived since civil society is a site for the production of both politicality and apoliticality."

A set of constituents emerged in answer to the research question, Complementarity, Speed and Democracy, Rules of Engagement, Contingent Alliance, and Convergence. Convergence emerged as a central and unifying construct. Convergence is the uniting of people who are different, or even opposed, around a common cause. It is based on the presumption that diversity is critical to coalition success and that it needs be employed to leverage its many potential benefits. The analyses led to the conceptualization of the Convergence System, a model that employs global civil society (GCS) diversity to discern complementarity within GCS coalitions, to discover Points of Convergence, and to facilitate collective action toward shared objectives, thus enabling efficacious action by GCS within the international polity."

Interaction with the external environment plays an important role in determining organizational legitimacy, shaping actions and determining opportunities. The ability of an organization to effectively respond to and influence the external environment can potentially strengthen its legitimacy. This paper considers the issue of organizational legitimacy by using resource dependence and institutional theories to analyze the development of the Regional Environmental Center for Central and Eastern Europe (REC). The findings indicate that it is possible for an organization to maintain legitimacy through adaptation, responding to the rise and fall of external opportunities and challenges. As predicted by institutional theory, it also argues that external environmental factors place increasing pressure for conformity over time, limiting scope to maneuver over the longer-term."

A Case Study on NGO State Relations from Kerala, India"	"NGOs have, of late, found some of their traditional domains, such as provision of micro-credit and participatory development, coinciding with or being taken away by the state. How do they position themselves and retain relevance vis-a-vis the state in the changed scenario? Tracing the trajectory of interventions of a local NGO in Kerala, India, this article shows that NGOs exhibit 'multiple identities' selective collaboration, gap-filling and posing alternatives in the process of engagement with the state. The 'strategizing' of such identities may hold the key to their relevance vis-a-vis the state."
991	2010	VOL	21:03	"Trends in Development Aid, Negotiation Processes and NGO Policy Change"	"Non-governmental organizations (NGO) and government donor agencies (GDA) are often caught in a dilemma, an NGO between responsiveness to its target group(s), expectations of individual donors and demands of its GDA, GDA between its policy to respect NGO's integrity, its wish to keep NGOs accountable for received fund and its operation within the bounds of its general policies. This dilemma is mirrored in the NGO GDA negotiation for funds. Based on negotiation theory and using three explanatory approaches, 18 years of negotiations between an NGO, Vi Skogen (ViS) and its GDA, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida), are analyzed in order to demonstrate how organizational structures, power relations and the context influence the outcome of the negotiations. All three approaches help to explain how ViS managed, mainly in the interest of its individual donors, to resist changes demanded by Sida and also to explain how the agendas of ViS and Sida finally converged."

"This study examines the conditions that facilitate the growth of international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) in 126 countries, from 1982 to 2000. To explain the uneven growth of INGOs around the world, I test two competing theoretical approaches. The top-down perspective of growth focuses on the degree of a country's integration into the world polity and international economy. The bottom-up perspective emphasizes the development of democracy and the prosperity of the domestic economy as significant factors in facilitating INGO growth within a given country. An econometric analysis of panel data with ordinary least squares (OLS) suggests that both economic and political factors at the global and national level explain the rise of INGOs, rather than viewing either in an isolated fashion."
993	2010	VOL	21:03	Civil Society Capacity Building for Democratic Reform: Experience and Lessons from Indonesia	"This article examines civil society strengthening experience in Indonesia to illuminate issues, challenges, and lessons for non-governmental organization (NGO) capacity building and international donor-supported democratic reform. The authors conceive of capacity as a function of contextual factors, and internal factors associated with an individual NGO or a network of NGOs. Contextual factors that need to be taken into account in Indonesia include weak reform implementation, state distrust of NGOs, and backsliding on some basic freedoms. Among the important internal features of NGOs in democracy promotion are overreliance on confrontational advocacy strategies, shallow organizational capacity, inability to cooperate to leverage impact, limited outreach to indigenous constituencies and sustainability problems. Indonesia's democracy-promotion NGO coalitions have largely operated as instruments of donor-supported reforms. As they seek to become socially embedded actors pursuing indigenous agendas, they face the need to confront the various expectations of their stakeholders regarding their roles and legitimacy, develop flexibility to respond to new engagements with government and with citizens, and address their internal capacity gaps. Three cases are presented that illustrate both the problems and the encouraging progress with government NGO collaborations in democratic governance."

It shows that recent calls for the transformation of NGOs into TMFIs help improve the financial sustainability and the breadth of outreach of microfinance activities. However, this transformation hinders the depth of the services provided by TMFIs. This is especially significant in the case of bank-TMFIs and suggests that although the transformation might increase the financial independence of TMFIs, it might cause a mission drift that both NGOs and policy-makers ought to consider."

I map Japan's state citizen relations through an analysis of the transformations of volunteering in Japan from Hoshi (mutual obligation) to borantia (borrowed from the English volunteer). The article broadly considers these paradigm shifts in terms of the context of the role International Non Profit Organizations (INPOs) play in Japanese foreign policy.

Two hypotheses: the organizational culture that governs these organizations is necessarily oriented toward acceptance, involvement and participation, and the rules and setting must be flexible and inclusive of all members in order to enable each organization to survive. Methodology was based on 91 semi-structured interviews. Findings indicate that Italian Voluntary Organizations must necessarily embrace an organizational culture whose rules and norms are oriented toward attracting men and women to join and encouraging them to participate. Implications for for-profit organizations are also discussed."
997	2010	VOL	21:04	Female Leadership in French Voluntary Associations	"Drawing on a recent national survey, this article focuses on the female representation on executive committees in French voluntary associations. To begin with, we observe that this representation is very unequal according to the different officer positions. It is especially low among presidents while it is markedly higher among secretaries. Then, we study the relationship between the associations' attributes and the likelihood of women being appointed as executive committee members. Our investigation bears out some findings from previous studies on nonprofit female leadership. For instance, we show that the proportion of female officers is higher in organizations whose activities pertain to social service, health, and humanitarian sectors. It is lower in the oldest associations and it decreases as their geographical area of activity increases and as their budget becomes larger. But we also emphasize new results. First, the probabilities that women hold president, treasurer and secretary positions are highly correlated to each other. Second, the likelihood that associations have female presidents is higher in associations with few volunteers. We consider possible explanations for the latter result."

Increasingly volunteering is seen as a way of benefiting health and building sustainable communities. In a study in 2007 we aimed to address the research questions: what are the motivations for, barriers to, and benefits of formal practical environmental volunteering for those individuals involved? Qualitative and quantitative data collection was undertaken while spending a day each with ten volunteer groups as they undertook their practical conservation activities. In this paper we focus primarily on the physical, mental and social well-being benefits that volunteers derived from their activities. Our research involved 88 people volunteering regularly in a range of places from scenic natural landscapes to urban green spaces in northern England and southern Scotland. Respondents described a range of benefits they gained from their involvement including improved fitness, keeping alert, meeting others and reducing stress levels. We suggest that practical environmental volunteering has flexibility in the types of activity available and the time scale in which activities are undertaken and therefore can provide a range of physical, social and mental well-being benefits to people with very differing abilities and from different socio-economic backgrounds."
999	2010	VOL	21:04	Negotiating the Boundaries of Voluntarism: Values in the Indian NGO Sector	"Values are an essential part of the identity of non-government organizations (NGOs), distinguishing them from other sectors and contributing to their legitimacy. Values are neither uncontested nor wholly self-determined, but rather are products of the broader social and political environment. The meaning of values must be negotiated with multiple actors, such as funding agencies, the state, and the general public including their clients. This paper looks at the ways that the meaning of a particular NGO value voluntarism is negotiated and contested in India. I argue that conceptualizations of voluntarism are neither singular, nor static, and that NGOs draw on these to claim legitimacy, or contest them through counter-narratives. These struggles over the meaning of voluntarism are in themselves productive, shaping organizational identity, and functioning. Values can thereby be a useful analytical tool to understanding NGOs."
1000	2010	VOL	21:04	Donor Misreporting: Conceptualizing Social Desirability Bias in Giving Surveys	"Although survey research is one of the most frequently used methods for studying charitable giving, the quality of the data is seldom stated or known. In particular, social desirability bias (SDB) has been found to distort data validity where respondents tend to over-report what is socially desirable and vice versa. We argue that this phenomenon has not been fully understood in the nonprofit context as existing social desirability scales are not appropriate to be used in giving surveys. Thus, this paper is the first to extend understanding of SDB to the nonprofit context and to explore its motivating factors. Based on a multidisciplinary literature review and qualitative interviews with various senior practitioners from the fundraising and marketing research sectors, it is suggested that SDB is a multidimensional construct yielding five dimensions, namely, impression management, self-deception, level of involvement, perceived benefits and social norms. The paper then discusses the implications for nonprofit researchers and concludes with directions for future research."

This study advances on previous overviews by providing more updated numbers for organization size, age, gross revenue and employment levels, as well as their distribution across the ICNPO third sector activity classification. The evolution of these variables from the period 1997 to 2007 is also analyzed. The Portuguese third sector has been fast growing, with revenues amounting to 5.64% of Portugal's GDP and employment representing 4% of the country's employment in 2007. It is mainly composed of very small organizations, with diminutive revenues. Perhaps its most striking features are the uneven distribution of employment and revenue and the strong concentration on social services."

A Critical Discourse Analysis of (PRODUCT) RED	"Increasingly, traditional notions of philanthropy are colonized by a market discourse that promotes consumption as an effective way to solve social ills, resulting in what scholars have termed marketized philanthropy. This paper examines the implications of marketized philanthropy through a discourse analysis of the (PRODUCT) RED campaign benefiting the Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis in Africa through consumption of (RED)-branded products. This paper explores the implications of a business-oriented model of philanthropy for bringing about social change, the repercussions of campaigns like (RED) that explicitly shed the label of philanthropy, and how they impact political engagement."
1003	1990	NML	01:01	Lessons for successful nonprofit governance 	"Boards of nonprofit organizations malfunction as often as they function effectively. As the best-managed nonprofit organizations demonstrate, both the board and the executive are essential to the proper functioning of a nonprofit organization. These administrative organs must work as equal members of a team rather than one subordinate to the other. Moreover, the work of the executive and the board does not divide neatly into policy-making versus execution of policy. Boards and executives must be involved in both functions and must coordinate their work accordingly. In a well-functioning nonprofit organization, the executive will take responsibility for assuring that the governance function is properly organized and maintained."
1004	1990	NML	01:01	Changing labor market patterns in the nonprofit and for-profit sectors: Implications for nonprofit management 	"A decade ago, women who chose to work in the nonprofit sector made relatively small monetary sacrifices. However, recent data point to a marked decline, during the 1980s, in the wages of women in the nonprofit sector relative to women in the for-profit sector. This relative decline in wages is likely to lead to labor shortages in the nonprofit sector if nonprofit managers do not engage in active policies to attract new workers."
1005	1990	NML	01:01	Defining leadership and explicating the process	"Leadership is the ability to get participants in an organization to focus their attention on the problems that the leader considers significant. This article identifies three functions of leadership organizational, interpersonal, and decisional. It relates these functions to the task of attention focus and enumerates the ways in which leaders can focus the attention of participants."
1006	1990	NML	01:01	Management implications of government funding of nonprofit organizations: Views from the United States and Canada 	"Most American authors approach nonprofit institutions as an alternative to both for-profit and public provision. This view suggests that the issues surrounding governance focus on the tension between the needs of individuals who finance or benefit from the activities of nonprofits and the goals of those who manage them. A different paradigm is more appropriate in much of the rest of the world. This article focuses on Canada, where the decision to use nonprofit organizations is made largely by governments. Examples from the Canadian experience with health care, higher education, day care, and television illustrate this difference and some of the implications for nonprofit management that follow from it."

It then suggests some steps that voluntary organizations might follow to take advantage of these concepts."
1008	1990	NML	01:02	The growth of the nonprofit sector in the 1980s: Facts and interpretation	"The nonprofit sector was the growth sector of the 1980s. This is the conclusion reached from detailed examination of the growth trends of major industry groups in New York State in the years 1981 through 1987. The analysis in this article suggests that the growth of the nonprofit sector was due primarily to the strong orientation of the economy toward services, where the nonprofit sector has traditionally had an important presence. Within service industries as a whole, the nonprofit and for-profit sectors grew at comparable rates, however, nonprofit growth was concentrated in semipublic services and in services where information is often difficult for consumers to acquire and understand, while the for-profit sector grew in simpler and more privately oriented services. The analysis shows that the nonprofit sector filled much of the gap left by reduced or stagnating government services. However, the growth of the nonprofit sector may be difficult to sustain in the future if sufficient entrepreneurial talent and other resources are not forthcoming."
1009	1990	NML	01:02	"Why do nonprofit managers accumulate surpluses, and how much do they accumulate?"	"Most theories of nonprofit behavior assume that nonprofit managers run surpluses only temporarily and that managers choose a budget level equal to expected revenues. In reality, equity accumulations have intrinsic value to nonprofit managers, and equity balances of nonprofits do grow over time. The authors discuss the tax treatment of nonprofits under U.S. tax laws, present existing theories of nonprofit behavior, and consider the reasons a prudent nonprofit manager might wish to earn and retain surplus funds. Data from a 1983 national sample of nonprofits are used to show that a large majority of nonprofits earned surpluses in 1983, that surprisingly few nonprofits had surpluses close to the zero level, and that the size of a nonprofit's surplus was related to its equity and asset holdings."
1010	1990	NML	01:02	Profits and incentive compensation in nonprofit firms	"Incentive contracts based on profit sharing, cost reduction, or other measures of performance no longer need to endanger a nonprofit firm's tax exemption, such measures have been urged for adoption in the nonprofit sector. However, the nonprofit differs from the for-profit sector in that contracts have side effects on the solicitation and offering of donations and on the character of those who choose to work in the nonprofit sector. In addition, it is more difficult in the nonprofit sector to obtain an appropriate output measure for use in calculating bonuses."
1011	1990	NML	01:02	Conflicting managerial cultures in nonprofit organizations	The increasingly managerial orientation of both staffs and trustees of nonprofit organizations appears to have led to conflict rather than cooperation. A case study of an organizational crisis explores how managerialism has obscured some of the unique constraints under which nonprofits operate and suggests ways of making these constraints more salient.
1012	1990	NML	01:02	The effective nonprofit executive: Leader of the board	"Prescriptive approaches place the nonprofit board of directors at the hierarchical pinnacle of the organization's management structure. Empirical research finds this view incomplete at best. The results of an attribution study indicate that nonprofit chief executives are perceived as centrally responsible for outcomes. Given such centrality, what skills differentiate executives who are regarded as especially effective from others? This article describes research suggesting that more-effective executives provide leadership for their boards. The implications for executive behavior are reviewed."
1013	1991	NML	01:03	The propensity of governing boards to plan 	"This article examines the relationship between board characteristics and formal organizational planning in forty-four nonprofit organizations. The study found that ongoing and beginning planners were more likely than those with no planning experience or those that had abandoned planning after an initial experience with the process to have well-understood missions, boards that concentrated on higher-level policy issues, and boards that had clear structures for decision making. The data suggest that a coalition consisting of top management and board members needs to exist if a move toward the formalization of organizational structures and processes is to be sustained."
1014	1991	NML	01:03	Commercial ventures of religious organizations	"Religious groups represent almost 40 percent of all U.S. nonprofits. An empirical study of 105 religious-based commercial ventures suggests several conclusions and implications for practitioners and scholars. First, the earning of income is rarely the primary consideration or measure of success in the initiation and evolution of religious-based nonprofit enterprise. The primary purpose of religious venturing is to achieve social and spiritual aims, such as evangelism, provision of membership services, or economic development. Second, the philosophy of the groups studied was more cooperative than competitive vis-a-vis other nonprofit and for-profit groups. Third, the study's findings on staff difficulties within nonprofit enterprise are consistent with those of other studies and underscore the importance of using volunteers strategically and of clearly defining how enterprise activities fit into the organization's mission. Fourth, a spiritual dimension distinguishes the operation of religious nonprofits, especially the Christian groups, from secular enterprise."
1015	1991	NML	01:03	How nonprofits adapt to a stringent environment 	"Results from a survey of nonprofit human service agencies in Arizona are presented. Most agencies reported steady or declining revenues, increased competition with other agencies, and rising demand for services from clients who cannot pay. The strategies used to adapt to these changes ranged from small-scale productivity enhancements to responses involving a complete restructuring of the agency as well as cutbacks in client services. The discussion focuses on the implications of the results for the continued viability of these agencies and their ability to maintain their commitments to poor clients."
1016	1991	NML	01:03	Enhancing nonprofit resources through barter	This article discusses the objectives and formats that countertrade (barter) assumes as a means of expanding the financial and other resources of nonprofit institutions. Examples of the different types of agreements practiced by various types of institutions indicate the pervasiveness of the practice. The author calls for greater levels of institutional commitment to the proactive seeking and consummating of countertrade agreements.
1017	1991	NML	01:03	Leadership challenges for human service administrators	"This study addresses the challenges that human service administrators face in maintaining and moving their organizations forward. Twelve leadership challenge dimensions are identified, variations in these challenges across agencies and administrators are explored, and the implications of these findings for leadership development programs targeted at human service administrators are discussed."
1018	1991	NML	01:04	Fund-raising by hospital foundations	"1986 87 data for eighty hospitals in Ontario and their foundations are used to assess the influence of various socioeconomic characteristics of the constituent populations and selected characteristics of the beneficiary hospitals on foundation revenue. Six factors appear to increase hospital foundation revenue: a higher percentage of the population that is elderly, a lower percentage of the population born outside Canada, a higher percentage of the population that has not moved within the past year, a larger hospital market share, teaching-status for the beneficiary hospital, and a higher level of foundation expenses."
1019	1991	NML	01:04	Corporate funding of the arts in a turbulent environment	"Focusing on funding in culture and the arts, the author identifies a distinctive logic of company support for nonprofit organizations. Business giving is increasingly disciplined around company objectives, giving levels are driven by pretax earnings, and giving decisions are the province of managers who draw advice less from the arts community or public agencies than from other companies. At best, turbulence in government funding has modest effect on corporate support. In turn, change in corporate support has little impact on public backing. The separate logics of corporate and government support imply separate and distinctive long-term development strategies for nonprofit organizations."
1020	1991	NML	01:04	Religious fund-raising: The theology of stewardship	"In funding their national and international ministries, many mainline denominations report a shrinking financial base as local members and congregations change from the traditional unified budget approach to a designated or second pocket giving approach. This article traces the history of this development, relates it to biblical concepts of stewardship, discusses its implications for both religious and secular endeavors, and raises questions that require additional research."
1021	1991	NML	01:04	"Organizational metamorphosis: A study of eighteen nonprofit mergers, acquisitions, and consolidations"	"This article reviews the literature on nonprofit mergers and presents a study of eighteen nonprofit merger, acquisition, or consolidation transactions. The findings underscore financial reasons as the chief motivation for mergers and cite the inability of small agencies to compete as an important contributing factor. Morale and productivity declined when staff had serious concerns about their future. Good leadership and honest and open communication were considered vital to ensuring a smooth merger process."
1022	1991	NML	01:04	The financial information that nonprofit trustees need and how they can get it	"With one exception, the accounting principles governing the information reported on the financial statements of nonprofit organizations should be the same as those for business organizations, and trustees should use this information to decide on budgets and analyze actual performance in essentially the same way as do business boards of directors. The exception is that nonprofit organizations receive capital contributions, which are rare in business corporations. In some nonprofit organizations, especially colleges, the information that trustees actually receive is confusing because of the unnecessary use of fund accounting and other peculiarities. Nevertheless, trustees can insist on businesslike financial statements."
1023	1991	NML	02:01	Why nonprofit nursing homes pay higher nurses salaries	"t is generally agreed that nonprofit nursing homes pay higher wages to their employees, hire more staff per patient, and are thus more costly than for-profit nursing homes. We attempt to show that higher costs in nonprofit nursing homes are related to higher quality of care in these homes. Using the 1985 National Nursing Home Survey, we show that nurses in nonprofit nursing homes have different characteristics than nurses in for-profit homes and that these differences in characteristics account for the differences in wages, a finding consistent with our hypothesis concerning quality differences between types of homes."
1024	1991	NML	02:01	Japanese corporate philanthropy in the United States	"As Japanese companies rapidly become an integral part of corporate America, not-for-profit organizations are anxious to receive their philanthropic support. This article provides an introductory description of the scope, characteristics, and implications of Japanese corporate philanthropy in the United States. The author offers advice to American not-for-profits seeking Japanese corporate funding and discusses the current controversy over Japanese corporate philanthropy."
1025	1991	NML	02:01	Self-assessment by nonprofit boards	"Can nonprofit boards conduct accurate and trustworthy evaluations of their own performance? Factors that limit trustee self-assessments include problems with available instruments as well as with trustees critical abilities. Drawing upon previous research that identified six dimensions of board competencies, the author developed and field-tested a new instrument for use in board self-assessments. Information on the reliability and validity of this approach is presented, and implications are drawn for board efforts to monitor and appraise their performance."
1026	1991	NML	02:01	The formula funding controversy at the national endowment for the arts	"This article explores how nonprofit organizations respond to proposed changes in the relationship between the government and the nonprofit sector using a case study of the formula funding controversy at the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). The article shows how powerful notions of who should get to decide permeate and continually transform the funding debate, making public interest reforms of the process extremely difficult. The author concludes by suggesting that the victories the arts field can claim in defending the current practice of peer panel review at the NEA will turn out to be Pyrrhic victories, ultimately weakening the claim of the nonprofit arts on public resources."
1027	1991	NML	02:01	Incentive-based management for nonprofit organizations	"Nonprofit organizations should consider using incentive-based management programs so long as such programs are studied thoughtfully, implemented carefully, and closely tied to other important management practices. The article describes the experiences of one nonprofit organization, Citizens Scholarship Foundation of America (CSFA), in successfully conducting a staff incentive program during the past several years. The author also reports briefly on the results of a recent survey among CSFA staff involved in the incentive plan, outlining the benefits of such a program in helping the organization to reach its objectives. Finally, the author addresses potential pitfalls to avoid in implementing an effective staff incentive program."
1028	1991	NML	02:02	Career professional who volunteer: Should their motives be accepted or managed?	"Career professionals, such as business executives who devote their time and talents to committee work in voluntary organizations, are highly valued as volunteers. These professionals have a variety of motives for adding volunteer work to their demanding schedules. Should volunteer agency administrators accept and reward these motives indiscriminately, or should they try to mold them to conform to agency values? The answer, according to this study, is yes to both alternatives, depending on whether the aim is to improve these volunteers attitudes or their performance."
1029	1991	NML	02:02	Jane Addams and hull house: Historical lessons on nonprofit leadership	"Jane Addams, founder and head of Hull House, a social settlement in Chicago at the turn of the century, offers an intriguing model of a nonhierarchical, value-oriented manager and leader. As the head resident of a group of some twenty volunteer residents the staff of the settlement Addams created an organizational culture and structure that encouraged individual initiative and self-governance. Addams herself taught by example the value of tolerance and the meaning of social democracy, the moral goals whose attainment she sought."
1030	1991	NML	02:02	Enrollment management and strategic planning: Resolving a classic tension in higher education	"Enrollment management in higher education is an important tool to operationalize strategic planning. The ever present danger, however, is that short-term concerns will dominate enrollment management decisions and in turn postpone attainment of strategic planning objectives. This article describes three models of enrollment management and explains how each is supposed to be incorporated into strategic planning. It uses classical growth theory from economics to explicate the dilemma of long-run and short-run objectives in conflict and develops an integrated model for strategic planning and enrollment management. Finally, some ways in which this analysis might apply to other nonprofit institutions are suggested."
1031	1991	NML	02:02	How nonprofit human service organizations manage their funding sources: Key findings and policy implications	"Major findings and policy implications on how nonprofit social service organizations manage their funding relations are summarized. Data from in-depth case studies of six medium-sized social service organizations with distinctive funding profiles yielded findings on the major contingencies associated with controlling fees, the volatility of donations, and the driving force of public funding. The article examines the implications of these diverse funding relationships for funders (public and private), nonprofit managers, and the role of nonprofit organizations."
1032	1991	NML	02:02	Redefining the board's role in fiscal planning	"Board approval of an operating budget, a traditional exercise of board authority, can trivialize board leadership and stultify managerial prerogatives. Considered within a new governance paradigm, conventional budget approval is not only unnecessary, but dysfunctional. This article argues that boards should proactively establish policy for financial planning and then require administrative budgeting throughout the year to meet the policy criteria. The result is that boards stay focused on the bigger issues, particularly program priorities and goals, leaving managers the authority to create and adjust budgets within policy boundaries."
1033	1992	NML	02:03	Nonprofit organizations as franchise operations	"This article examines the structural relationship between national nonprofit organizations and their local affiliates. For a substantial number of nonprofits, the national-local relationship can be modeled as a franchise relationship. The author considers ways in which the franchise system serves to mitigate a number of the organizational and economic problems facing nonprofits. Finally, particular devices used by franchises are examined, focusing on the ways in which national organizations tax their local affiliates and the extent of territorial restrictions placed on local affiliates."
1034	1992	NML	02:03	The strategic challenges of cooperation and competition in British Voluntary Organizations: Toward the next century	"The interrelationships between public, private, and voluntary sectors in Britain have witnessed increasing levels of change in recent years. This article argues that there have recently been identifiable trends within the voluntary sector, namely, increased levels of competition between sectors, increased competition between voluntary organizations, and increased pressures toward professionalization in voluntary sector management and organization. Predominantly competitive strategies and modes of professionalization have often been borrowed uncritically from commercial best practice by voluntary organizations. Thompson's (1967) typology of strategies is used as a basis for proposing cooperation as an alternative to competition in the British voluntary sector."
1035	1992	NML	02:03	Volunteers in feminist Organizations	"The use of women volunteers, a hotly debated issue among feminists in the 1970s, currently receives little attention, even in the literature. What few studies are available are often contradictory. These studies approach the issue of women volunteering from three main perspectives: (1) as a substitute for work, especially for married women, (2) as a stepping stone for reentry into the work force, or (3) as a form of exploitation. Two main groups of women volunteers are identified in the literature: middle- to upper-class civic leaders and lower- to middle-class service providers. In this article, we examine whether the use and management of women volunteers in feminist organizations is consistent with feminist ideology that opposes unpaid work by women. Our findings, based on a comprehensive study of fifteen feminist organizations, indicate that the use of volunteers is often contrary to feminist ideology. We conclude with a discussion of ways in which volunteer management in feminist organizations can be made more compatible with feminist ideology."
1036	1992	NML	02:03	Administrators of volunteer services: Their needs for training and research	"Despite the importance of volunteer administrators to nonprofit and many government organizations, little systematic research has been focused on these officials. Using a large national survey of volunteer practitioners conducted in 1989-1990, this article examines empirically several hypotheses concerning organizational support to meet administrator needs for continuing education. Using the survey responses, the article also elaborates the subjects recommended by the administrators for treatment in a basic seminar in volunteer management, in an advanced seminar, and in further research."
1037	1992	NML	02:03	Effective boards: How executive directors define and develop them	"There is growing recognition in the nonprofit field that the executive director has a key role in determining whether the board of directors will function effectively. To aid executives in this vital role, two recent studies defined a good board from the point of view of two samples of executive directors of community agencies, then sought factors related to board performance as measured by this definition. In interviews, executives whose boards scored higher than their peers on this performance measurement related how they work with their boards in such areas as recruitment of new members, financial management, fundraising, and leadership development."
1038	1992	NML	02:04	"Volunteers motivations: A functional strategy for the recruitment, placement, and retention of volunteers"	"A psychological strategy for understanding the motivational underpinnings of volunteerism is described. In a presentation that merges the theoretical interests of researchers with the practical interests of volunteer administrators, six different motivational functions served by volunteerism are identified, and an inventory designed to measure these motivations is presented. The implications of this functional approach for the recruitment, placement, and retention of volunteers are then elaborated. Finally, recommendations are provided for volunteer administrators who seek to increase the number of people who volunteer and to improve their human resource management."
1039	1992	NML	02:04	Moral responsibilities of trustees: Some first thoughts	"The role of a trustee is unclear to most people, including many trustees. The author proposes a view of trustees as persons who have public responsibility for private or independent provision of a public good. This is a moral definition of trusteeship, without trusteeship a pluralist society would be in trouble. The author argues that trustees should be constrained by fiduciary duties, the common good, an interpretative responsibility, and some procedural norms."
1040	1992	NML	02:04	Coping by nonprofit organizations during the reagan years	"Contrary to expectations that a divested federal role would lead to the demise of nonprofit agencies, the relationship between nonprofit and government sectors in New York at the end of the 1980s was stronger than ever. This article presents longitudinal data for six nonprofit agencies in Rochester, New York, to demonstrate management by groping along during the Reagan years, behavior that resulted in increased reliance on state and local governments for funds and programs and in different ways of doing business."
1041	1992	NML	02:04	Funding uncertainty and nonprofit strategies in the 1980s	"The degree to which strategic action is related to changes in the perceived uncertainty of income from major types of funders was examined for a panel of nonprofit organizations. Uncertainty was found to be a pervasive phenomenon. Nonprofits in some parts of the sector reported increases in uncertainty over time, while those in other parts reported decreases. The use of new revenue, legitimation, or retrenchment strategies was associated with the reduction of uncertainty for some types of nonprofit organizations but not for others."
1042	1992	NML	02:04	When the management is the message: Relating values to management practice in nonprofit organizations	"The values-expressive character of many private, nonprofit organizations is what distinguishes them from business and government organizations. The distinctive character of these organizations creates a special context for their management. This article examines the origins and development of private nonprofits in the religious realm and explores the implications of this character for management and for education of nonprofit managers."
1043	1992	NML	03:01	From comparative advantage to damage control: Clarifying strategic issues using swot analysis	"The principal ingredient of strategic planning is SWOT analysis the assessment of organizational strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. SWOT can be either a powerful management tool or a superficial and even misleading exercise. Much depends on the care with which decision makers integrate their analyses of internal and external factors affecting the future of the organization. This article presents a simple yet powerful framework for identifying and clarifying four types of strategic issues facing nonprofit organizations."
1044	1992	NML	03:01	The quality of employment in the nonprofit sector: An update on employee attitudes in nonprofits versus business and government	"Results from a survey of a national sample of 1,190 working adults update findings collected in 1977 (Mirvis and Hackett, 1983) on the characteristics and attitudes of people working in nonprofits. As in the earlier survey, it shows that people employed in the private nonprofit sector gain more satisfaction from their jobs than their counterparts in business and government and have more trust in their management. still, people working in nonprofits are just as concerned that their employers will take advantage of them and, in contrast to the 1977 survey, are no more psychologically committed to their organizations than are people in the other sectors."
1045	1992	NML	03:01	Predictive models for annual fundraising and major gift fundraising	"For most nonprofit organizations, the selection process for determining the best individual prospects for capital campaigns or annual fund drives are ad hoc and intuitive. Our research provides two statistical models developed from the alumni database at Northwestern University for both major gifts and annual fund prospects. One model predicts which individuals will give $100,000 or more over three years, the other, $1,000 or more. Our work provides a means of more efficiently selecting fundraising prospects. In our analysis, we combine geo-demographic data with the internal data typically found in alumni databases. A metric is presented to test the viability of the models when compared to single-criterion models. We show that past giving is the strongest single factor in predicting future giving. However, full models provide superior overall results."
1046	1992	NML	03:01	The strategic restructuring of nonprofit associations: An exploratory study	"In the past decade, many voluntary associations have reported experiencing tension and frustration in the relationships between central offices and local affiliates. The current challenge is how to maintain cohesion of the association and the utility of the central office while accommodating the desire of affiliates for autonomy. Based on an eighteen-month exploratory study of the evolution of two associations, this article explores these tensions and offers five propositions for the effective restructuring of the leadership and governance of associations over time."
1047	1992	NML	03:01	Paying nonprofits: Streamlining the new york state system	Many state and local governments now rely on contracts with nonprofit organizations to deliver a broad range of public services. Nonprofits benefit from these contracts but can also experience costly delays in obtaining payment for services delivered. The article describes two laws adopted by New York State to curb these delays. One law deals with slow payment of vouchers. The other addresses the costly problem of delayed delivery of contracts for activities such as child care or services to the disabled where nonprofits cannot stop delivering services without harm to the recipients.
1048	1992	NML	03:02	Foundations as investment managers part 1: The process	"Foundations in the United States manage more than $130 billion in investment resources. In managing these assets, foundations must balance the competing goals of promoting charitable good deeds through the distribution of grants and stewarding the assets that can support such grants in the future. This paper examines how foundations perform the function of managing their financial assets and whether they follow modern practices of portfolio management in doing so. The data presented here provide reason to suspect that many foundations are giving insufficient attention to preserving and enhancing the available philanthropic resources under their control. Analysis of actual investment performance is the subject of a sequel article in the next issue of Nonprofit Management and Leadership."
1049	1992	NML	03:02	Is governing board behavior cyclical?	"An empirically derived model of cyclical board behavior holds that following a nonrecurring founding period, a board typically progresses through a sequence of three distinct operating phases and then experiences a crisis that initiates the whole sequence over again. During each cycle, board members become progressively less interested in the agency's mission and programs and more interested in the board's bureaucratic procedures and the agency's reputation for success in the community. Although the sequence of phases is predictable, the timing of them is not. As a conceptual framework, the model integrates the results of a variety of valuable, but otherwise unrelated, studies of governing board behavior. The cyclical model can also be used as a diagnostic tool that can enable a board member, executive director, consultant, foundation officer, or public funder to analyze quickly a particular board's perspective and potential."
1050	1992	NML	03:02	Power in and around nonprofit boards: A neglected dimension of governance	"In this article we propose five patterns of board governance based on the distribution of power in and around boards of nonprofit organizations. The typology proposed grew out of our findings in in-depth case studies in which the dispersion of power became the critical variable for making sense of the patterns of governance observed. These governance patterns were then incorporated into a survey of boards in the voluntary sector. We present the results of this latter phase of the research by focusing on the associations between the five patterns and the background characteristics of board members, organizational and environmental variables, and board and organizational effectiveness. The results of the study suggest that power is an important while largely neglected aspect of board governance in the not-for-profit sector."
1051	1992	NML	03:02	Corporate charitable contributions to not-for-profit organizations in Israel	"This article analyzes the nature and structure of corporate charitable contributions in Israel. The core of the research involves estimating income and price elasticities of corporate philanthropy in Israel. These two parameters, as measured in this article, suggest that tax incentives should be increased in Israel if philanthropy is to be encouraged."
1052	1992	NML	03:02	Ethical dimensions of nonprofit administration	"This article explains why ethics is a necessary and powerful aspect of organizational life and why the managerial ethics of executive responsibility is arguably the most important part of management. While ethical considerations in management are largely the same regardless of organizational type, there are some unique characteristics of nonprofit organizations that create a special ethical context for the nonprofit administrative role. This uniqueness, the immensity and organizational complexity of the American nonprofit sector, and the importance of ethical considerations in an increasingly amoral society, are grounds for giving more attention to this topic."
1053	1993	NML	03:03	Foundations as investment managers part II: The performance	"Foundations divide roughly into two groups in their investment behavior. Most follow an inactive, risk-averse style, focusing on income maximization rather than total return. Another, smaller group of foundations are more activist and aggressive, focusing on total return. This article analyzes the investment performance associated with these different approaches, showing that while a significant number of foundations are performing well, many others lag in their investment returns."
1054	1993	NML	03:03	Philanthropic styles	"The challenge of resource development, particularly among major donors, has led nonprofits to adopt marketing techniques, including market segmentation. The benefit segmentation approach used in this study of the giving motivations of 218 major donors reveals seven philanthropic styles: (1) Communitarians, (2) the Devout, (3) Investors, (4) Socialites, (5) Repayers, (6) Altruists, and (7) Dynasts. Examples of how knowledge of philanthropic styles can aid in nonprofit resource development are provided."
1055	1993	NML	03:03	Exploring the role of boards using total activities analysis	"This article describes a response called Total Activities Analysis (TAA)to the problem of defining the role of boards. TAA places the board's role within the context of all the activities carried out by a voluntary or nonprofit agency. The distinctive features of the TAA approach to defining the board role are the following: (1) it is analytical and exploratory rather than prescriptive, and (2) it considers the role of boards in relation to other roles within agencies. Both paid staff and board members have found TAA to be a useful practical tool."
1056	1993	NML	03:03	"Social policy, community service development, and religious organizations"	"The retrenchment policies of the Reagan and Bush administrations have made human service much more locally oriented. As a result, religious groups have become increasingly involved in providing services. This article explores some of the historical and contemporary aspects of service involvement by religious groups, focusing on the meaning this involvement has for the social work community. Recommendations are provided to aid community planners in working more effectively with the resources of religious groups."
1057	1993	NML	03:03	The university budget process: A case study	"In the past, contingency theory has been used by researchers to explain what factors influence the design and implementation of budget systems. However, little of this research has been conducted in the context of nonprofit organizations, especially private universities. Previous research on university budgeting has focused on resource allocation issues, and most of these studies have involved state institutions, which differ in significant ways from private universities. This article presents the results of a case study of the budgeting systems within three schools of a private university. Using a contingency approach, it describes the characteristics of the schools environments that appeared to affect the types of budget systems used by the three schools studied: a law school, a liberal arts school, and a school of management."
1058	1993	NML	03:04	How well is debt managed by nonprofits?	"Little is known about why nonprofits accrue debt, how much they owe, and whether the funds they borrow are used productively. This article distinguishes between productive, problematic, and deferred debt. Employing a data base representative of 114,726 tax-filing charitable nonprofits in the United States in 1986, it examines the pervasiveness of nonprofit debt and the relation between this debt and nonprofit financial health. The analysis finds that over 70 percent of the nonprofits hold debt, the distribution of this debt is highly concentrated, and the level of debt and leverage varies with asset size and type of activity. Nonprofits with higher leverage and absolute debt levels are financially healthier than those with lower levels. While the analysis does not determine whether financially stronger nonprofits are better able to borrow, the results support the view that borrowing in the nonprofit sector is economically efficient."
1059	1993	NML	03:04	The double-edged sword of social service contracting: Public accountability versus nonprofit autonomy	"The increased role of government contracts in the funding of nonprofits has heightened tensions as governments seek accountability and nonprofits seek to preserve autonomy. Considering both sides of the contract market, this article suggests that the threat of government funding is exaggerated. Nonprofits are attractive contractor options because of their experience and trustworthiness. Governments should recognize that excessive intrusions limit the advantages of the nonprofit sector. At the same time, nonprofits should be conscious of the implications of public funding, just as they must be of other sources of funding."
1060	1993	NML	03:04	Planning responses to voluntary sector crises	"Planning in voluntary organizations is examined as a response to external crises that jeopardize organizational survival. The voluntary sector in London was investigated in order to understand the extent, nature, and rationale of planning in response to an extreme change in the political and funding context of voluntary action during the mid 1980s. Planning and the ability to plan may be the benchmark of organizational survival in the future, as pressure to plan increases from many arenas and statutory penetration of voluntary organizations deepens. The dilemma this poses for voluntary organizations is discussed, and alternative planning approaches are proposed."
1061	1993	NML	03:04	Innovation by nonprofit organizations: Policy and research issues	"It is often claimed that a main reason public authorities and others use nonprofit organizations is that nonprofit organizations are innovative. But very little research has been conducted into innovative behavior by nonprofit organizations. How, then, does a funder formulate a policy with which to select innovative organizations? This article develops a classification matrix for types of innovations, sets out the elements of an innovation policy for a funder, and uses a review of the main theories of the spurs and inhibitions to innovation to consider how this ordering can be used in the construction of an innovation policy and as a framework for research."
1062	1993	NML	03:04	Policy and paper clips: Rejecting the lure of the corporate mode	"Should nonprofit organizations adopt the business corporation model of governance? This article examines the differences between business and nonprofit corporations and argues that adopting the corporate model would be a dangerous error for nonprofit organizations. Nonprofits need a governance structure that reflects their unique aspects: the complexities of defining corporate mission; lack of a universal measure of success; dominance of community members rather than corporate insiders on the board; accountability for the public trust; responsibilities to many constituencies; and board responsibility for fundraising. While acknowledging that many nonprofit boards need to solve problems of inefficiency and unclear understandings of board responsibilities, the author argues that adopting the corporate model is the wrong prescription."
1063	1993	NML	04:01	The first three years of NML: Central issues in the management of nonprofit organizations	"The articles published in the first three years of NML define a broad spectrum of management challenges and problems for future research. These issues fall into five broad categories: governance, executive leadership, human resources management, development of financial resources, and strategic adaptation to change. This article summarizes the contributions of NML authors and suggests areas where new research would advance understanding and practice of nonprofit management and leadership."
1064	1993	NML	04:01	The supply of volunteer labor: The case of hospitals	"Little is known about the labor market for volunteers, but even less is known about the supply of volunteers to particular industries. This article examines the supply of volunteer labor to one industry, hospitals, and the choices that volunteers make among hospitals with different ownership attributes. Survey data of volunteers at four hospitals located in Madison, Wisconsin, are used to estimate the importance of a number of factors influencing people's willingness to volunteer at hospitals. We found that job opportunities in the labor market and tax rates affect the supply of volunteers. We also found that volunteers are not indifferent to the type of hospital at which they volunteer, a federal government hospital, a nonprofit state-owned teaching hospital, and other nonprofit hospitals were not perfect substitutes in the eyes of individual volunteers in our study."
1065	1993	NML	04:01	Fundraising encroachment on public relations: A clear and present danger to effective trustee leadership	"When fundraising encroachment occurs, strategic publics who can affect a charitable organization's success and survival are rarely brought to the attention of trustees because public relations practitioners are denied access to these leaders, and the manager who does have access the fundraiser is trained and rewarded to concentrate on donor publics. A national survey documents fundraising encroachment in five of the six major types of charitable organizations. Although only 23 percent of the respondents (N = 175) reported structural encroachment, 40 percent agreed that the senior fundraisers in their organizations had more say in policy decisions than the senior public relations officers. Small but significant correlations were found between encroachment and the extent to which the public relations department has the knowledge and expertise to practice two-way models of public relations and communications support."
1066	1993	NML	04:01	The impact of funding sources and board representation on consumer control of service delivery in organizations serving low-income communities	"This article examines the influence of funding sources and board members on the degree to which an organization enhances consumer control of the organization or limits access to services for some groups of clients. Based on a study of decision making in organizations serving three low-income communities, a limited degree of board influence on an organization's choice of service strategies can be traced to both the power of donors to demand service strategies that reflect their interests and the efforts of staff members to limit the ability of the board to engage in policy-making. The high degree of dependence of low-income communities on external funding restricts the development of boards as decision-making bodies that effectively reflect community interests."
1067	1993	NML	04:01	Using practitioners theories to document program results	"A form of self-assessment, termed practitioner-centered evaluation, is proposed for human services agencies. In contrast to assessment methods that may require an outside evaluator, this qualitative technique focuses on the informal theories of behavioral change that underlie a program-as-implemented. It takes into account interacting cause-and-effect relationships and relies on the ability of staff members to document success and failure in the context of their own theories. As a vehicle for identifying program elements that are effective in achieving behavioral change and other goals, practitioner-centered evaluation can be the basis of franker, more productive conversations between funders and grantees and between staff members and their governing boards."
1068	1993	NML	04:02	Culture and change in nonprofit boards	"The actions of boards, like all organizational behaviors, emerge from board culture, which is composed of members customary practices, shared beliefs, and assumptions about reality. It is a board's culture that enables its participants to deal with ambiguity and complexity by providing familiar meanings and solutions to problems. Board development efforts that do not take these factors directly into account are likely to produce only superficial and short-term changes. This article presents alternative approaches to board development, using two levels of learning drawn from examinations of board cultures."
1069	1993	NML	04:02	Aids volunteers and their motivations: Theoretical issues and practical concerns	"Volunteers and volunteer organizations are critical elements in society's response to the HIV epidemic. This article reviews a model of the volunteer process that draws on psychological theory and methodology and incorporates concerns of individual volunteers, volunteer organizations, and society at large. An inventory for assessing the motivations of AIDS volunteers is introduced. The findings from a survey of volunteers working in AIDS organizations around the United States speak to their motivations, their choices of volunteer roles, and their decisions about quitting or continuing service. Based on these findings, a detailed set of recommendations for effective volunteer recruitment, assignment, and retention is offered."
1070	1993	NML	04:02	The board-executive relationship in nonprofit organizations: Partnership or power struggle?	"The interactional dynamics of the board-executive relationship in the typical nonprofit agency are not well understood. This article first examines conflicting viewpoints in the literature and then describes an in-depth study of the board-executive dyad at four nonprofit organizations, using decision making as the focus. The data suggest that, in noncrisis situations, internal factors and the nature of the issue under consideration influence which pattern will be adopted and that the stability arising from this kind of leadership accommodation strongly contributes to organizational effectiveness."
1071	1993	NML	04:02	"A guide to journal articles on strategic management in nonprofit organizations, 1977 to 1992"	"This article is a guide to over a hundred journal articles on strategic management in nonprofit organizations, published from 1977 to 1992 in nineteen leading general management or nonprofit journals. The guide provides brief summaries of articles, organized into widely accepted strategic management topic areas and research categories. The article indicates areas where substantial foundations of knowledge exist and where such bases are lacking. It distinguishes between works on general nonprofit management and those on empirical research."
1072	1993	NML	04:02	The maturity of corporate giving and its long-term consequences	"This article, which is based on the author's experience with corporate giving programs, discusses the principal impediments to large-scale corporate giving prior to World War II, traces the growth of corporate contributions over the past fifty years, and suggests that the procedures and practices now used by most of the largest public companies are evidence of a high degree of maturity with respect to corporate giving. Certain contributions procedures that are now common among major companies are described, together with some of the consequences of these developments for nonprofit organizations."
1073	1994	NML	04:03	Creating trust with major donors: The service encounter model	"Although the wealthy individuals who create charitable trusts exert considerable influence on the $123 billion of charitable giving, very little is known about this segment. Aside from data about the size of donations and emerging information about their motivations, the philanthropic and marketing literature is largely silent on issues surrounding major philanthropic acts. For example, what aspects of the service encounter catalyze support and create a successful experience? What are the prior constituent, voluntary, and donor behaviors of individuals who create trusts exceeding $1 million? What support is required from nonprofit and external legal and financial advisers? This article provides a model of the trust creation process framed by insights from the services marketing literature, documents the process empirically, and draws out implications for nonprofit resource development."
1074	1994	NML	04:03	The artistry of leadership: An exploration of the leadership process in voluntary not-for-profit organizations	"Recent efforts in research on leadership in voluntary not-for-profit organizations, research that has influenced the education and training of leaders, have been concentrated on identifying the behaviors or competencies of effective leaders. This article, while recognizing the value of competence typologies, questions the dominance of that approach and proposes that more research attention should be paid to the wisdom, creativity, and insight of leaders of voluntary organizations, focusing on their theories-in-use, which they use to create the meaning of their own and others experience and action."
1075	1994	NML	04:03	Culture and human resources management: Selecting leadership in a nonprofit organization	"This article examines the influence of culture in a nonprofit organization on a major human resources management decision: the selection of a new leader. Specifically, this article investigates the recent selection of the national executive vice president (known as EVP, the highest-ranking, paid staff member) in the American Cancer Society and details how three particular aspects of the culture influenced the structure, process, and outcome of the selection decision."
1076	1994	NML	04:03	Fiscal management in government-funded nonprofit organizations: An exploratory study	"Nonprofit human services organizations are playing an increasingly important role in the implementation of government programs. Yet little is known about how the fiscal affairs of these organizations are managed. This article explores the fiscal and budget practices of a group of affiliated nonprofit human services organizations in the western United States in an effort to provide a preliminary assessment of the capacities of these organizations, which have become so critical to the execution of public policy. The findings demonstrate that the organizations surveyed are making widespread use of many sophisticated management tools and methods in their budget processes."
1077	1994	NML	04:03	Diversity and equity among foundation grantmakers	"This article examines a number of diversity and equity issues related to grantmakers, primarily by using data from the Council on Foundations. In general, the percentage of minority grantmakers approximates their percentage in the overall population. Questions are raised about whether grantmakers receive equal pay regardless of race and whether minority grantmakers disproportionately work on issues related to their population group. The article concludes with a description of the research data that would be needed to definitely answer these types of questions."
1078	1994	NML	04:04	Outstanding leadership in nonprofit organizations: Leadership competencies in Roman Catholic religious orders	Effective leadership is essential for nonprofits to focus their energies beyond survival and toward accomplishment of their unique missions. This article describes a study of the leadership competencies of a sample of outstanding and typical leaders of Roman Catholic religious orders. The authors present a framework for understanding the characteristics that define excellence in the leadership of nonprofits.
1079	1994	NML	04:04	The governance of nonprofit organizations: Law and public policy	"Who should have the right to set the objectives of nonprofit organizations, hire their managers, set compensation standards, and in general control these organizations? Current law and public policy do not provide answers to these questions. Often, nonprofit organizations are controlled by managers and members of the boards of directors or trustees (many of whom are appointed by management). The goals of these individuals may not best serve the interests of those who support the operation of nonprofit organizations. This article proposes a legal and policy framework for empowering consumers, donors, and sponsors those who have an economic demand for the nonprofit form of organization. The framework establishes a formal status of membership, accords standing in the court of law to members, enhances direct information dissemination by nonprofit organizations, and empowers state-sponsored agencies to support and oversee nonprofit organizations."
1080	1994	NML	04:04	The impact of ownership form and regulatory measures on firm behavior: A study of hospices	"This article examines differential responses to the Medicare hospice benefit across ownership types. The analysis reveals little difference in costs or quality of service among government-owned, for-profit, and nonprofit hospices. However, there are significant differences in the numbers of patients served by ownership status. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that nonprofit hospices are patient maximizers, not profit maximizers in disguise who are aiming to circumvent the nondistribution constraint. A comparison of these results with those in the hospital and nursing home industries leads to the conclusion that Medicare regulations and the predominance of Medicare revenues in an industry induce similar outcomes in cost and quality across ownership types."
1081	1994	NML	04:04	Interdepartmental relations and voluntary organizations: An exploration of tensions and why they arise	"This article explores the nature of interdepartmental relations in voluntary organizations, looking, in particular, at the relationship between fundraising and service-providing departments. The findings indicate that the relationship between these two departments can be problematic, and the sources of tension between them are outlined. The author examines the question of why tensions arise. The fact that, for the voluntary organization, the needs and preferences of the service funder and the service recipient can be very different may be part of the explanation. Finally, the implications of the findings for our understanding of the role of voluntary organizations and the strategies they adopt are explored."
1082	1994	NML	04:04	Why nonprofit organizations are ripe for total quality management	This article reviews the core philosophy of Total Quality Management (TQM) and argues that TQM can enhance the accountability of nonprofit organizations to their many constituencies. A case study of TQM in the United Way of Allegheny County illustrates applications and results.
1083	1994	NML	05:01	Nonprofit boards and perceptions of funding	"The study presented in this article examines the extent to which board characteristics and activities are associated with the executive director's level of certainty about future funding, using a sample of 127 human service agencies. The executive directors of agencies with low levels of funding adequacy expressed more certainty about future funding when their boards were more expert, influential, and involved in planning and fundraising activities. For agencies with more adequate funding, board expertise and activities were associated with lower levels of perceived funding certainty. This article argues that, rather than improving agency performance, boards serve a homeostatic function, acting in crisis situations to return their organizations to stable equilibria."
1084	1994	NML	05:01	What affects nonprofit survival?	"This article describes mortality patterns for nonprofit organizations in a major U.S. metropolitan area between 1980 and 1988. Twenty percent of the nonprofits in a panel ceased operations during this period. Mortality rates were found to vary widely. In some instances, high mortality was found in parts of the sector that were growing rapidly. Overall, nonprofits that ceased to operate were younger and smaller, used fewer strategies to attract funders, and had less diversified income streams than survivors. These patterns also varied substantially. The results point to the drawbacks of using limited or commonsense information and the necessity of theory-based research."
1085	1994	NML	05:01	Local development agencies: Supporting voluntary action	"This article examines the role of local development agencies (such as Rural Community Councils and Volunteer Bureaux) in developing and supporting local voluntary action. It finds these agencies equipped with the potential to make a significant contribution to their communities, in particular by taking on a strategic role as catalysts for service development. The article ends with a series of recommendations both for the management of these agencies and for the roles of central and local government in supporting them. Taken together, these recommendations specify the preconditions for the successful realization of this potential of local development agencies."
1086	1994	NML	05:01	Religious giving in the united states	"Research on religious giving in the United States contains several important lessons. Denominations differ immensely in their giving levels, with conservative Protestants giving the most, liberal Protestants giving at moderate levels, and Catholics giving the least. Personal religious commitments and the level of one's disposable income are the main determinants, but, in addition, interpersonal factors produce a strong skew in the amounts given. Annual pledging and deliberate planning of giving have clear effects."
1087	1994	NML	05:01	The liability of nonprofits to donors	"The success of the third sector depends on public confidence, and that confidence rests, in part, on holding managers, directors, and officers of nonprofits responsible for their conduct. This accountability can be accomplished by clearly defining the roles of these individuals and the standards that they are to uphold, and by providing channels for all interested parties to challenge uncontrolled activities. Though interest in this goal is unanimous, a debate exists over how to ensure oversight and accountability."
1088	1994	NML	05:02	Structure and adequacy of human service facilities: Challenges for nonprofit managers	"Findings from a statewide survey of nonprofit human service organizations in Illinois show great diversity in access to and use of facilities. Large proportions have facility-related problems that will require substantial investments beyond the financial capacity of the organizations themselves. The findings also point to major shortcomings in attention to or knowledge about facility-related problems among managers of these organizations. The findings have important policy implications for nonprofit managers, as well as for public and private funders and policy makers."
1089	1994	NML	05:02	Improving direct mail fundraising through segmentation research	"Currently, fundraising for medical research (and most other charities) seems to be conducted more on the basis of intuition or trial-and-error guesswork than it is guided by strategic planning. The efficacy of segmentation research is examined, from the more traditional demographic segmentation techniques to newer segmentation schemes, including motivational segmentation and geo-demographic segmentation. The methods are compared on their ability to identify active, high-value donors and generate insights to help formulate more effective appeals from the better understanding of donor groups provided by the segmentation results."
1090	1994	NML	05:02	Human service organizations and self-help groups: Can they collaborate?	NO ABSTRACT
1091	1994	NML	05:02	Board members influence on the government-nonprofit relationship	"This study examines whether, how, and under what conditions nonprofit boards of directors influence the government and voluntary sector relationship. The survey responses of executive directors and board presidents in a randomly selected sample of 400 nonprofit organizations indicate that boards are not bystanders in the contracting relationship with government. Rather, many boards play multiple roles, simultaneously enhancing interdependence and maintaining the boundary between state government and nonprofits."
1092	1994	NML	05:02	"Is there a third way? a comparative analysis of how the law treats workers in the nonprofit, private-for-profit, and public sectors"	
1093	1995	NML	05:03	The political dimension of effective nonprofit executive leadership	Recent research by the authors adds to their evolving model of the leadership provided by effective chief executive officers of nonprofit organizations. Effective chief executives understand the centrality of their leadership role and accept responsibility as initiators of action with their boards to find resources and revitalize the missions of their organizations. These actions are carried out as part of the political dimension of effective executives. The importance of this criterion of leadership practice is examined in light of the hesitance of chief executives to espouse or advocate political action. Implications for chief executive training and development are discussed.
1094	1995	NML	05:03	"Cause-related marketing, philanthropy, and the arts"	"Joint fundraising and promotional programs between businesses and nonprofits, often referred to as cause-related marketing, have been on the rise. During the 1980s, many large corporations initiated cause-related marketing programs. Less is known, however, about how widespread cause-related marketing has become among medium-size companies. In the study of 478 medium-size businesses reported here, one-fifth made contributions to nonprofits as part of cause-related marketing programs, and more were becoming interested, but many of the businesses were dissatisfied with the effect of their contributions to nonprofits. Satisfied business participants actively recommended nonprofits to other business owners and intended to increase their own contributions. The authors provide additional insights on business donor motivation through their application of the Seven Faces framework."
1095	1995	NML	05:03	The organization of religious congregations: Tackling the issues	"This article considers responses to the practical problems of organization that arise in religious congregations. Accumulated research findings on the organizational features and issues of congregations are synthesized and discussed under three themes: purposes and goals, the role of clergy, and growth and change. Theoretical frameworks that have been used to analyze congregations are reviewed, and it is suggested that further useful insights can be obtained by conceptualizing congregations as nonprofits and by building on knowledge about their organization and management. At the same time, the author argues, there are distinctive features of congregation organization that demand the development of more specialist theory."
1096	1995	NML	05:03	On the malfunction of the generic approach in small voluntary associations	"Management and marketing techniques that are of great value in private firms may not prove as important in voluntary and nonprofit organizations. The author highlights problems in the direct application of the so-called generic approach to third sector organizations by examining small voluntary organizations in the Danish sports sector. He argues, first, that it may be unnecessary to apply generic management techniques, second, that it may be dysfunctional with regard to leadership and management, and, third, that the consequences of the chosen (generic) strategies may be detrimental to the function and image of the associations. Instead, theories of organization, strategic management, and marketing should recognize the special mix of competing, complementary, and overlapping values, rationales, and evaluation criteria that characterize small voluntary organizations."
1097	1995	NML	05:03	Corporate philanthropy: Gift or business transaction?	"Much of the terminology and behavior surrounding corporate philanthropy reinforces the perception of it as a form of business transaction, rather than gift exchange. While the analogy to a business transaction is accurate in many ways, this article illustrates what is lost by avoiding the metaphor of the gift in reference to corporate philanthropy. By exploring the cultural meaning behind the gift-exchange relationship, the author reveals the social functions of gift exchange in corporate philanthropy. Language that avoids this strong parallel deprives us of provocative insights into corporate philanthropy as a modern extension of complex relationships among individuals and institutions that have been practiced throughout history. The author develops these parallels in order to counterbalance the trend toward treating and thinking about corporate philanthropy strictly as a business transaction."
1098	1995	NML	05:04	Effective nonprofit board members as seen by executives and board chairs	"This article examines the personal and professional attributes of nonprofit board members-their values, behaviors, and skills-as seen through the eyes of chief executives and board chairs. In the study reported here, an inductive research methodology was employed in order to bring to the surface the underlying assumptions of executive directors and chairs regarding their expectations of board members."
1099	1995	NML	05:04	Volunteers from corporations: Work cultures reflect values similar to the voluntary organization's	"The way people perceive the culture of the organizations where they are employed may shape their perceptions of their role as volunteers. This study of 201 managers and other professionals suggests that their perceptions of their work organizations as sociocentric or egocentric are related to their motives, attitudes, and performance in a voluntary organization. Implications for voluntary agency administrators include the identification of work organizations whose cultures reflect values similar to those of the voluntary organization."
1100	1995	NML	05:04	Merging nonprofit organizations: Analysis of a case study	"This article presents a case study of merging among nonprofit organizations that provide social and community services. The study sheds light on the dynamics and problems of merging nonprofit organizations, whose espoused ideology focuses on promoting the well-being of their clients. The author describes and analyzes a merger in metropolitan Jerusalem, Israel, and highlights the potential problems that may ultimately undermine its success. This merger is the outcome of an ongoing power and political struggle. The analysis focuses on the organizational ideologies and culture as well as the strategies and structure of the merging organizations. In addition, the author deals with the underlying motives for merging, the driving and restraining forces, and the implications of merging nonprofit community services organizations with other social and human services organizations"
1101	1995	NML	05:04	Pursuit of mission: The rise and fall of elite nonprofit leadership	"The University Circle Development Foundation (UCDF) was created in 1957 to implement a master plan for the development of Cleveland's University Circle district. Run by the presidents of three major institutions, UCDF was successful in coordinating land use and construction projects in its early years. However, its elite authority structure proved insular and inflexible when dealing with students, faculty, and adjacent neighborhoods, and it was dissolved in 1970."
1102	1995	NML	05:04	The major gift donor relationship: An analysis of donors and contributions	"Securing major gifts for nonprofit organizations can involve considerable cost. This study examines the relationship developed between 233 major gift donors and the development office at Northwestern University over a five-year period. The results show that the cultivation and solicitation process is usually long, measured in years rather than months, and the extent of the effort varies by type of donor and category of gift. Vignettes describing one of the relationships from each of the five most important categories are presented."
1103	1995	NML	06:01	Managing traditionality and strategic change in nonprofit organizations	"Fundamental differences with the for-profit sector, and that sector's own experiences, make it unwise for nonprofit leaders to adopt business organizations externally focused approach to strategic change. Theories of organizational survival and punctuated equilibrium models of change and continuity, as well as the authors research, suggest that planning aimed toward matching the organization to changes in its environment has limited value. This article argues that due to the relative constancy of societal needs and nonprofits missions, and the importance of society's demands for reliable, accountable performance, nonprofits should greatly value continuity. Utilizing a typology of changes that nonprofits may confront, the authors clarify why potential organizational change should be approached cautiously, with a strong regard for traditionality as a mechanism of continuity. They then sketch some of the implications of this perspective for nonprofit sector researchers and leaders concerning the role of traditionality in successful organizational adaptation, including the value of historical analyses and the healthy tension between traditionality and change."
1104	1995	NML	06:01	"Do profits crowd out donations, or vice versa? the impact of revenues from sales on donations to local chapters of the American Red Cross"	"This article examines the relationship between donations to the American Red Cross and the profits, sales, costs, and prices of health and safety classes offered by local chapters. Two important questions are examined: Do profits from sales of services crowd out donations to local chapters of the American Red Cross? Do managers respond to changes in donations by changing prices, output, or costs of saleable services? The results suggest that nonprofit managers should pay close attention to the potential impact on donations of any change in the prices charged for saleable goods and services, and that profits, costs, and prices of services are influenced by donations."
1105	1995	NML	06:01	Nonprofit social services in Moscow: Leadership and administrative issues	"This article presents the findings of a study of nonprofit human services organizations in Moscow, Russia, in the early stages of development of the nonprofit sector. It addresses the following issues of relevance to social welfare in particular and nonprofits in general. First, what is the legal status of nonprofits? Second, what leadership and governance mechanisms have evolved? Third, how are resources, both financial and human, obtained? And, finally, how can Western consultants be useful in addressing the unique and specific needs of nonprofits in Russia as they bring their expertise into this setting?"
1106	1995	NML	06:01	The sexual division of leadership in volunteer emergency medical service squads	"This article reports on theoretical and empirical research that explored the hypothesis that there is a sexual division of leadership in volunteer emergency medical service (EMS) squads. This hypothesis was tested against survey data obtained from 216 current members of nine upstate New York volunteer EMS squads. Despite several mitigating characteristics of these organizations, and despite the lack of supporting statistical evidence at the aggregate level of officership, the research found statistically significant confirmation of sex bias in officer selection when leadership was disaggregated into line and staff officer positions. Medical qualifications and length of EMS squad membership were also included in the model as determinants of leadership experience. These results are discussed relative to the question of the sexual division of leadership in the overarching nonprofit and voluntary sector of the U.S. economy."
1107	1995	NML	06:01	Roles consultants play in successful fundraising interventions	This article draws on previous research by the author in which the long-term effectiveness of technical assistance grants in fundraising was studied. Successful and unsuccessful interventions by fundraising consultants in that earlier study are compared using several descriptions of the role of the consultant from organizational development literature. This comparison helps define the roles played by successful consultants in fundraising interventions and provides a number of suggestions for both organizations and consultants as to how to make such interventions successful.
1108	1995	NML	06:02	Accountability and nonprofit organizations: A historical perspective	"American nonprofit organizations first developed in the nineteenth century as the organizational instruments through which Americans put their First Amendment freedoms of religion and political belief into practice. For one hundred years American nonprofits were held accountable by relatively small, compact communities of people who shared religious or other highly defined beliefs and values. In the twentieth century, many nonprofit organizations have grown very large and have adopted a scientific, general-service-to-the-community ethos. The legal, institutional, and cultural ideas and practices through which traditional nonprofits were, and are still, held accountable no longer seem to work equally well for the larger, more universal nonprofits of the late twentieth century."
1109	1995	NML	06:02	Accountability of nonprofit organizations and those who control them: The legal framework	"Legal accountability, understood as either an obligation to meet prescribed standards of behavior or an obligation to disclose information about one's actions even in the absence of a prescribed standard of behavior, is imposed on nonprofit organizations and those who manage them by state law and by federal tax-exemption law. A perception that charities are exempt from both the electoral control that holds government accountable and the market forces that discipline business encourages a tendency to look to law to ensure accountability in the charitable sector, to perceive that shortcomings in the law are responsible for shortcomings in the sector, and to conclude that repair or reconstruction of the legal framework is the appropriate corrective. However, although the legal framework is far from perfect, sweeping change will not likely solve the problems and may well undermine the most positive characteristics of the sector. Some aspects of accountability cannot and should not be the subject of legal rules. Efforts to make charities accountable by redrawing legal standards of behavior in accord with popularly recognized standards of propriety, or even excellence, are likely to be counterproductive. Instead, adjustment of the legal framework in the hope of improving accountability should be incremental and should be evaluated in the context of organizing principles and core values that reflect our best understanding of the unique strengths of the sector and the functions it serves in our society."
1110	1995	NML	06:02	Accountability and nonprofit organizations: An economic perspective	"A popular concern is whether the managers of nonprofit enterprise are accountable. This article considers accountability in the context of three questions. First, how do groups establish a basis on which to hold managers accountable? Second, to whom should a manager be accountable? Third, can a person or group make it important to a manager to act in the best interests of the person or group? These three questions are addressed by the fields of public choice theory, social choice theory, and principal-agent theory, respectively. A cynical way of summarizing the seminal findings in these areas of research is that public choice theory proves that groups will be unable to form, social choice theory proves that once a group forms, it will be unable to make good decisions, and principal-agent theory proves that a decision, once reached, is impossible to implement. A more optimistic view is that the problems identified by these research findings contain the seeds of their own solution, and that thereby valuable lessons for nonprofit managers can be adduced"
1111	1995	NML	06:02	Accountability and nonprofit organizations: An ethical perspective	"Given limited market regulation and no direct voter regulation, how nonprofit organizations can be made accountable is a serious and long-standing issue for the sector. The expectations and demands of various constituent groups associated with nonprofits are often conflicting and even contradictory. Nonprofits need to come to terms with legitimate expectations, base them on reasonable standards, and work through each of them in ways consistent with the others and with the respective missions of the organizations."
1112	1995	NML	06:02	Accountability in organizational life: Problem or opportunity for nonprofits?	This article reviews the notion of accountability as an intrinsic experience in daily organizational life and contrasts it with the more traditional construct of accountability as an external control or monitoring device. The concept of felt responsibility can provide an opportunity to enhance the effectiveness of nonprofit organizations. Both research and the author's field experiences in nonprofit settings suggest how nonprofit leaders and managers can use felt responsibility to help individuals act with accountability to themselves and to others. The concept of conversation for accountability poses a pragmatic opportunity for nonprofits in particular to turn the current environment of finger pointing and aggressive monitoring into an enabling organizational practice that benefits both nonprofit members and their clients or constituencies.
1113	1996	NML	06:03	"Languages, ideologies, and cultures in nonprofit boards"	"This exploratory study identifies three language domains within the boards of directors of nonprofit human services agencies: mission, operations, and manners languages. These languages are connected to values and express ideology. Findings suggest that operations concerns tend to displace mission considerations, with manners language facilitating this displacement."
1114	1996	NML	06:03	Women on boards of nonprofits: What difference do they make?	"In this article, the authors explore the impact of women on nonprofit boards. From a sociological perspective, they look at the actual proportion of women on boards and, from a more psychological perspective, at the sex of the chief executive officers in order to examine the impact of these variables on board effectiveness, structure, and process. The study results, based on data from a cross section of Canadian nonprofits, indicate that as the percentage of women on a board increases, the dynamics of the board are significantly affected."
1115	1996	NML	06:03	Volunteers in charity retailing: Recruitment and training	"Volunteer activity has received considerable research attention in recent years. There is, however, little academic research to date into volunteer issues in charity retailing. This article examines volunteers in charity shops and reports, in particular, on how volunteers are recruited and trained in the charity retailing. This article examines volunteers in charity shops and reports, in particular, on how volunteers are recruited and trained in the charity sector. The authors conclude that in an increasingly competitive market, charity retailers need to reexamine their recruitment and training policies in order to attract and retain a diverse core of volunteers."
1116	1996	NML	06:03	Factors characterizing the most effective nonprofits managed by volunteers	"This article reports on an empirical study of thirty-nine volunteer-managed nonprofit organizations (voluntary associations, not paid staff nonprofits) in a small suburb of Boston. Reputation for effectiveness in achieving goals has been found to be significantly associated with nonprofit nature, governance, and formalization. Many hypotheses suggested by others for nonprofit organizations with paid staff do not seem to transfer to volunteer nonprofit groups. Practitioners can utilize the present findings to improve volunteer nonprofits."
1117	1996	NML	06:03	The validity of supplementary pay systems in nonprofit organizations	"The theory and assumptions used by nonprofit organizations when adopting employee incentive pay systems are examined in this article. A theory to explain the use of financial incentive is described. This theory states that nonprofit employees are motivated, like employees in the for-profit sector, to seek financial rewards contingent on achieving certain performance goals. To validate the Theory, a review of select literature is provided."
1118	1996	NML	06:04	Careers in the third sector	"The article explores the concept of career as it relates to third-sector employees. The results of a survey of third-sector employees in New South Wales, Australia, suggests a distinctive pattern of work orientation involving a preference for work that is both personally challenging and socially meaningful. Pragmatic considerations are also important for women with young children. These and other findings suggest that the majority of third-sector employees pursue a career that more closely fits Driver's spiral career model rather than the conventional linear career model. It therefore behooves nonprofit employers to tailor the organizational reward system to the motivational needs of their employees if they hope to maximize worker satisfaction and effectiveness."
1119	1996	NML	06:04	Structure and accountability a study of national nonprofit associations	"n the 1990s, the integrity and performance of nonprofit organizations in the United States have come increasingly under attack, and there are new calls to hold nonprofit organizations more accountable for their behavior and performance. This article reports on a study of the organizational structures of national nonprofit associations and asks how these umbrella organizations can help to self-regulate the sector through appropriate checks and balances between the national organization and local affiliates. The authors identify a number of differences in how associations with alternative structures hold local affiliates and national organizations responsible for their performances, and they conclude that structure is an avenue of self-regulation for nonprofit organizations deserving further attention."
1120	1996	NML	06:04	Boards of directors in nonprofit organizations do they follow a life-cycle model?	"In this study the authors used data from a survey of Canadian nonprofit organizations to empirically test hypotheses derived from models of nonprofit board life cycles. The authors suggest that while formal structural elements of board behavior change in the manner suggested by life-cycle models, the more enacted or behavioral aspects of nonprofit boards do not. The data further suggest caution in the use of life-cycle or age-dependent models to either explain or guide nonprofit board behavior."
1121	1996	NML	06:04	Board performance and organizational effectiveness in nonprofit social services organizations	"This article examines the tasks and responsibilities of nonprofit boards of directors and explores the relationship between board performance and organizational effectiveness. Thirty-three activities in nine areas of board responsibility were examined through questionnaires and interviews with board members and chief executive officers of sixteen nonprofit organizations serving developmentally disabled adults. Rankings of organizational effectiveness were determined using external evaluators and accreditation surveys. A significant relationship between board performance and organizational effectiveness was found, and the board activities most strongly correlated with organizational effectiveness are reported, including policy formation, strategic planning, program monitoring, financial planning and control, resource development, board development, and dispute resolution."
1122	1996	NML	06:04	"Cause-related marketing, fundraising, and environmental nonprofit organizations"	"This article provides policy guidance to environmental nonprofit organizations, and, secondarily, to other nonprofits, that are considering entering into a cause-related marketing (CRM) alliance. Toward that end, insights into establishing CRM committees, sponsorship development, and regulatory awareness are offered to environmental nonprofit managers. The author argues that strong consumer support for local environmental concerns translates into strategic fundraising opportunities for regional, state, and local environmental organizations that have underutilized CRM in the past."
1123	1996	NML	07:01	Why donors give	"This study examines motives that lie behind personal philanthropy and explores how donors are different from nondonors, and why donors give the amounts they do. It then suggests a general model of individual donating behavior consisting of five predictor variables."
1124	1996	NML	07:01	Competing nonprofit organizations also collaborate	"Cooperation among voluntary organizations is examined from the perspective of an Israeli project in which local voluntary organizations formed a joint forum. An analysis of questionnaires filled in by members of nine such bodies (roundtables) shows that cooperation among voluntary organizations may be functional in nature and not necessarily based on common goals. The degree of independence of the organizations did not affect their cooperation, but it influenced the way they looked on the convenor (external change agent), who played an important role in the process of interorganizational cooperation. The authors show that competition and cooperation are not mutually exclusive among voluntary organizations."
1125	1996	NML	07:01	Corporate political strategy: A framework for understanding nonprofit strategy	"Nonprofit organizations operate in environments characterized by institutional demands for legitimacy. The authors argue that, given this environment, corporate political strategy is critical to a nonprofit's ability to achieve its goals, gain access to resources, and achieve a sustainable advantage. The authors develop this thesis by providing a conceptual argument that corporate political strategy is critical given the institutional nature of the environment, the conflicting demands of multiple stakeholders, and the role of the funder; and by providing contextual evidence of the role of corporate political strategy in nonprofit strategy."
1126	1996	NML	07:01	Nonprofits accommodate the information demands of public and private funders	"In the absence of performance reporting standards, nonprofit organizations face difficulties in accommodating the varied and changing informational requirements of public and private funders. Clients, volunteers, management, and staff also use and demand performance information. The authors studied four human services organizations in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, and their performance reporting across the management cycle, from planning through implementation and monitoring, to external reporting and auditing. The authors analyzed documentary evidence and conducted interviews with users of performance information. they conclude this article by proposing a set of general standards nonprofit organizations can use in performance reporting."
1127	1996	NML	07:01	The effects of flexible work arrangements	"Recognizing the dearth of research on flexible work schedules in nonprofit organizations, the author conducted a statewide survey of Illinois independent nonprofits as well as follow-up personal interviews with top administrators in select user organizations. Survey results indicate that a substantial proportion of these nonprofit organizations used flexible work arrangements. Four arrangement types in particular flextime, parttime, compressed work week, and telecommuting were found to be used more frequently in Illinois nonprofits than other research findings suggest. Although follow-up interviews revealed that the percentages of employees in the various types of arrangements were low, overall arrangement use improved staff retention and morale and maintained performance. More than half of the administrators interviewed expected the use of all arrangement types to increase in the future."
1128	1996	NML	07:02	Exploring structure-effectiveness relationships in nonprofit arts organizations	"The authors examined nineteen nonprofit performing arts organizations, investigating the distribution of influence among organizational members, the grouping of volunteers and staff in organizational structures, and the effectiveness of the organizations. The organizations effectiveness was assessed using multiple performance indicators. The analysis revealed five groupings or configurations of influence, which correlated to the organizations exhibiting the highest and lowest levels of organizational effectiveness. The authors conclude that a variety of structures are associated with good performance but structural dysfunctions are associated with organizational failure, and that members commitment to an organization's structure is an important element of success."
1129	1996	NML	07:02	Strategy formulation in nonprofit social services organizations: A proposed framework social services organizations	"This article proposes a framework for determining strategies in nonprofit social services organizations. A review of the literature concerning strategy choice models is combined with an analysis of the unique characteristics of nonprofit social services organizations to develop the proposed framework, which improves on existing models by encompassing a wider array of strategic factors and being applicable to a wide variety of nonprofit organizations. The author provides examples of the model's applications, discusses the usefulness and limitations of the model, and concludes with suggestions for future research."
1130	1996	NML	07:02	AIDS funding and the rhetoric of scarcity	"This article describes the rhetoric of scarcity, a viewpoint that focuses on the inadequate past support for and the uncertain future of AIDS funding. This view is at variance with the consistent rise in financial support for AIDS and with the criticism from some quarters that AIDS is being overfunded relative to other diseases. The rhetoric of scarcity expressed by members of the AIDS community is distinctive but not unique to HIV/AIDS and can be traced to qualities of the epidemic and the ways in which nonprofit organizations obtain their funds."
1131	1996	NML	07:02	"Intermediary bodies in the 1990s: New settings, old problems?"	"Intermediary bodies liaise between the voluntary and statutory sectors. Frequently, they have also functioned as local development bodies. This article examines changes in the position of intermediary bodies following the growth of welfare pluralistic policies in the late 1980s, as viewed from the framework of a case study of the Council for Voluntary Service in northwest England. The author concludes that while the voluntary and statutory sectors may now be more willing to accept an intermediary role for such bodies, it remain difficult for them also to undertake development work."
1132	1996	NML	07:02	The news value of nonprofit organizations and issues	This article reports on a study of the newsworthiness of information about nonprofit organizations and issues. The two-part study included content analysis of news stories in the 1991 editions of the San Francisco Chronicle and interview with editors and reporters at the paper.
1133	1997	NML	07:03	Fairness and reputation effects in a provision point contributions process	"This article reports on an investigation of how issues of fairness and reputation affect individual contributions in a group decision-making setting. In the context of a threshold public goods provision experiment, treatments were performed to determine how individuals react to limited and unlimited information about the contributions of other group members. Experimental results show that revealing anonymous information about individual contribution behavior caused a concern about equity, which led to decreased average contributions and a higher variance in contributions. These effects were partially offset when individual-specific contribution information was displayed. In their conclusion, the authors discuss how the results apply to different fundraising environments."
1134	1997	NML	07:03	The performance of performance indicators in the arts	"The introduction of performance indicators into the field of the arts and culture has been fraught with difficulties. It is the premise of this article that many of those difficulties can be traced to tensions arising out of the actual uses of performance indicators in the arts. Based on concrete examples of the use of performance indicators, the author examines four different functions affecting behavior, evaluating behavior, monitoring behavior, and inferring behavior and explores some of the issues arising from each one."
1135	1996	NML	07:03	Arts management cutback strategies: A cross-sector analysis	"The turbulent economic climate of the arts in the 1990s raises the question of how arts managers are coping with this situation. Exploratory factor analysis of responses from 237 Australian arts managers in public, private nonprofit, and private for-profit sectors revealed seven different strategic responses: cost reduction, political, cooperative, downsizing, refinancing, commercialization, and relocation. Private sector managers were more likely to use the refinancing strategy, and nonprofit and public managers were more likely to use the political and cooperative strategies. Implications for arts managers in using these strategies are explored."
1136	1996	NML	07:03	Is there an afterlife? How nonprofits move toward self-sufficiency as foundation dollars end	"Nine demonstration projects were funded under the John A. Hartford Foundation's Generalist Physician Initiative. This article focuses on how these nonprofit grantees dealt with shortterm funding and the approaches they used to integrate program elements into parent health care systems. Continuation strategies included leveraging with foundation dollars, restructuring physician practices, enhancing community connections, modeling collaboration, and cross-fertilizing projects. In order to succeed, project managers needed to be sensitive to project selection, transition planning and reporting, project organization and design, management and integration, cultural differences, and project dissemination and support."
1137	1996	NML	07:03	Remissioning nonprofits: Two case studies of membership associations	"The mission of a mutual benefit association is so inexorably intertwined with its membership that a change in one cannot succeed without a corresponding change in the other. Two case studies of United Ways state associations remissioning initiatives give details on the dynamic interplay of mission and membership in mutual benefit associations, a fundamental characteristic that distinguishes them from public benefit nonprofits. To anticipate change, association managers must focus on the shifting demands from their members stakeholders. They also must clearly understand the nature of their membership and who represent their members when members are organizations, and they must be ready to engage in intra-association politics to effect a change in mission."
1138	1996	NML	07:04	The anticipated growth of nonprofit unionism	"Although unions are not typically associated with nonprofit organizations, many nonprofit agencies have unionized work forces. The author predicts that there will be an increase in the number of unions representing nonprofit employees. Parallels are drawn between the evolution of unions in the public and nonprofit sectors."
1139	1996	NML	07:04	Board practices and board effectiveness in local nonprofit organizations	"This study of sixty-four locally governed nonprofit charitable organizations used a social constructionist perspective to investigate the relationship between the extent to which nonprofit boards use prescribed board practices and stakeholder judgments of the effectiveness of those boards. A social constructionist perspective implies that different stakeholders use and evaluate different kinds of information in making judgments about board effectiveness. The results suggest that there is wide variation in the use of the prescribed board practices, that judgments of board effectiveness often differ substantially, and that chief executives judgments of the effectiveness of their boards is moderately related to the extent of use of recommended board practices."
1140	1996	NML	07:04	The relationship between formal planning and performance in nonprofit organizations	"A study of 240 YMCA organizations revealed that regardless of organization size, those organizations that used a formal approach to strategic planning had higher levels of financial and social performance than those with less formal processes. The better performers also assigned the responsibility for planning to a strategic planning subcommittee of the board rather than to the board's executive committee or to an outside consultant."
1141	1996	NML	07:04	Public funding and institutional reorganization: Evidence from the early kindergarten movement	"During the last quarter of the nineteenth century, nonprofit kindergartens exhibited many modern characteristics such as comprehensive services, community outreach, and developmentally appropriate practices. By the beginning of this century, most of those modern characteristics had been eliminated as kindergartens became integrated into the public school system. This article analyzes the institutional reorganization of nonprofit kindergartens under public control by applying and extending Thomas H. Jeavons framework. The author argues that the observed institutional reorganization was caused by adaptation to the legitimizing principles of the public sector. It is important to understand this dynamic well to correctly assess the effects of public funding and ownership on nonprofit organizations. This article is especially relevant to those following policy arguments for public funding of preschool programs."
1142	1996	NML	07:04	Society in motion: Russia's emerging voluntary sector	"During autumn 1993 and spring 1994, the author worked as a consultant and trainer for a group of independent social organizations in the city of Voronezh, central Russia. In this article he discusses the main features of voluntary sector development in that city and the characteristics of associations currently active there. The findings indicate a voluntary sector that is both extensive and diverse, in which self-organizing mutual aid is the predominant organizational form. The findings are discussed against a historical background that traces the development of independent social activism in the former Soviet Union back to the pre-Gorbachev period. It is this background that may help to explain the rapid growth and surprising complexity of the sector today."
1143	1997	NML	08:01	Efficiency in religious organizations	"Churches must realize that the management of their human resources is critical. The U.S. Catholic Church in recent years has been this problem take on even more significance with the apparent shortage of priests. This article considers this problem in light of a relatively new methodology, data envelopment analysis, which compares organizations to comparable best-practice units. The authors conclude that the Church would benefit from a better distribution of priests, both within and across dioceses. They also conclude that the use of deacons and priestless parishes can be effective in some circumstances."
1144	1997	NML	08:01	Corporate philanthropy and united way: Challenges for the Year 2000	"This article reports the results of a national survey of corporate philanthropy programs in which the influence of strategic philanthropy on corporate contributions to United Way was investigated. The results indicate that highly strategic philanthropy programs gave a lower percentage of total direct contributions to United Way than less strategic programs. Strategic philanthropy was defined in this study as the process by which contributions are targeted to meet both business objectives and recipient needs. Based on the results of the study, the author encourages United Way staff and other nonprofit managers to work more closely with corporate contribution managers to develop measurable criteria regarding the impact of health and human services contributions on strategic business goals and objectives."
1145	1997	NML	08:01	Structures of multinational nonprofit organizations	"Investigations of the structures of multinational organizations have been primarily limited to the multinational for-profit form, while examinations of alternative structural arrangements of nonprofit organizations have been focused on single-nation organizations. This article draws on the extensive descriptive literature on nonprofits and the theoretical literature on the structural determinants of organizations to make predictions about the potential range of structures of multinational nonprofits. The authors show that local resource density and environmental variation are key factors in determining multinational nonprofit structures. They conclude that nonprofit organizations operating in multiple national settings are likely to be structured as umbrella organizations that act as an additional layer of hierarchy for multiple indigenous organizations, and that unitary, hierarchical corporate structures are not likely to be found in these organizations."
1146	1997	NML	08:01	"Government, funded nonprofits, and accountability"	"Internationally, nonprofit organizations are being held to account for how they spend public funds. This issue of accountability has emerged as a theme in nonprofit-state relationships. Exploring the state side of that relationship in Australia, the author suggests that significant constraints hinder the ability of state funding bodies to manage accountability processes for grant funds. The interviews summarized and reported here were conducted before the full impact of a contract regime was felt. The issues identified permit reflection on the possible mediating impact of different political systems on accountability processes, and on the limitations of principal-agent frameworks in building accountability processes and state-nonprofit relations."
1147	1997	NML	08:01	Fidelity in philanthropy: Two challenges to community foundations	"Two recent court cases have raised doubts about how faithful community foundation officials must remain over time to the donor's charitable intent. For trustees of community foundations, nonprofit managers, and potential donors, the two cases discussed in this article raise three critical questions: Under what conditions can and should a donor's charitable intentions be modified? Do nonprofit organizations have legitimate claims to funds in community foundations earmarked for their organizations by donors? Should donors consider disbursing their philanthropic funds themselves rather than seek to have them held in perpetuity in a foundation? In addition to addressing these questions, the author suggests that the two court cases examined here reveal something important about the broader evolution of philanthropy over the past three decades."
1148	1997	NML	08:02	Communication and donor relations: A social skills perspective	The work of donor relations in nonprofit organizations is accomplished through communication. This article suggests a relationship between social skills abilities and effective organizational communication. High-level social skills may facilitate strong relationships with potential donors and enable development personnel to address institutional goals more effectively.
1149	1997	NML	08:02	"Female participation in association governance and political representation: Women as executive directors, board members, lobbyists, and political action committee directors"	"This analysis of more than eleven hundred business, trade, and professional nonprofit associations identifies several internal organizational barriers to leadership for women. In addition, the analysis highlights the importance of female representation in governance positions, such as executive directors and board members, and of the selection of women as the political representatives of associations in roles such as lobbyists and political action committee directors."
1150	1997	NML	08:02	The 990 return: Beyond the internal revenue service	"The author recognizes the expanding role of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 990 Return in understanding the nonprofit sector and monitoring the strategies, operations, and performance of individual nonprofit organizations, operations, and performance of individual nonprofit organizations. She identifies major problems with the IRS 990 Return relative to its broadened use and provides suggestions for minimizing the problematic interpretation of IRS 990 data."
1151	1997	NML	08:02	A model for consulting to help effect change in organizations	"Rapid change in an organization's environment creates barriers to needed change in strategy and culture. Managers, and the consultants who are invariably called on to assist such efforts, face difficult challenges in working together to effect change. They often fail to achieve the desired results. The author offers a new model of consulting to help guide general managers and consultants in the creation of the necessary conditions for successful management of change. This model is based on lessons learned from case studies in the health care industry."
1152	1997	NML	08:02	Essential emotions: The place of passion in a feminist network	"Using a case study, the authors argue that emotions play a highly significant part in voluntary organizations, and that present significant part in voluntary organizations, and that present academic approaches to emotions are unhelpful, both theoretically and practically. The distinction between emotional work and emotional labor is unclear in nonprofit organizations using volunteers. More research is needed in this area."
1153	1998	NML	08:03	Executive Compensation in the Nonprofit Sector	"An examination of executive compensation in the nonprofit sector indicates that, as in the for-profit sector, the salaries of nonprofit executive directors depend heavily upon the organization's size. Among nonprofits, both ideology and the composition of revenues substantially affect executive compensation levels. The results of this study indicate broad differences across segments of the nonprofit sector and a strong role for ideology in the setting of compensation."
1154	1998	NML	08:03	The Adoption of the Corporate Governance Model by Nonprofit Organizations	"This article examines the circumstances under which nonprofit organizations adopt corporate governance practices. In the study reported here, the authors found that adoption of corporate governance practices depends primarily on the presence of a supportive institutional (that is, value) context as well as available resources to support governance restructuring. These findings strongly suggest that the adoption of structures and practices from the for-profit sector is neither a feasible nor even a desirable solution to problems facing many nonprofit organizations."
1155	1998	NML	08:03	Contracting and Patterns of Nonprofit Governance	"Executive staff and board members in nonprofit organizations that operate with government grants and contracts often work together to perform important governance functions. This shared responsibility can be predicted by strong executive leadership of the board, a board with highly regarded members, and affiliation with an influential statewide or regional association. The results of our research suggest that the distribution of governance responsibility in nonprofit organizations with government revenues should command the attention of researchers and activists."
1156	1998	NML	08:03	Resource Centers: A Foundation's Strategy to Support Nonprofit Grantees	"Resource centers (RCs) are one strategy used by foundations to provide technical assistance to, and to help disseminate the efforts of, multisite demonstration projects. Foundation goals must fit with RC purposes. Establishing the RC early in project development, carefully defining the scope of responsibilities, and locating leaders who can solve problems are critical considerations for foundation officers considering this strategy."
1157	1998	NML	08:03	Reducing Funding Risk and Implementing a Fundraising Plan: A Case Study	Small nonprofit organizations in the health care and human services fields can find themselves frozen into a dependence on government funding. They run the risk of constricting their management choices and neglecting other potential funding sources. Often a fundamental shift in attitude is necessary in order to deemphasize service-based contracts and to transform private fundraising into a central activity of the business.
1158	1998	NML	08:04	Governance in Public-Private Community Health Partnerships: A Survey of the Community Care Network SM Demonstration Sites	"This review of the governance practices of twenty-five public-private partnerships involved in addressing a broad range of community health needs shows that governance in public-private community partnerships departs significantly from traditional notions of institutional governance. Governance structures and degrees of progress toward governance goals vary widely and appear to be systematically related to the organization, composition, location, and activity of each partnership."
1159	1998	NML	08:04	Do Intentional Efforts to Improve Boards Really Work? The Views of Nonprofit CEOs	"Commentators on the effectiveness of nonprofit boards of directors usually find them wanting in a number of ways and urge that they reform themselves. A study to ascertain how many boards actually accept this advice and intentionally attempt to change the way they operate also examines what changes boards attempt to make, what provokes their efforts, and what outcomes result."
1160	1998	NML	08:04	The Views of Nonprofit Executives on Educating Nonprofit Managers	"Extraordinary nonprofit-sector expansion has produced organizations with complex missions and operations, and the managers responsible for their effectiveness require adequate preparation. Although no single degree program stands out as the clear preference of nonprofit executives, we propose that certain organizational characteristics are associated with the preference for specific degrees."
1161	1998	NML	08:04	"Innovation, Professional Interests, and Nonprofit Organizations: The Case of Health Care in Poland"	Nonprofit organizations have a role in spreading technological innovation. The experience in Poland illustrates that entrepreneurial health care professionals prefer nonprofit organizations over for-profit organizations to introduce novel services to the market because nonprofits create favorable public perceptions of those services.
1162	1998	NML	08:04	Youth Development: On the Path Toward Professionalization	"Youth development in the United States is making a transition from social movement to emerging profession. This article marks the path of this transition; charts achievements in developing core competencies and skill standards, training and education programs, career ladders, evaluations, and public awareness; and suggests the next steps in staff development that managers of nonprofit youth and human service organizations should consider."
1163	1998	NML	09:01	Altruists or Egoists? Retention in Stipended Service	"This study examines stipended volunteers those volunteers who engage freely in a helping activity within a formal organizational structure but receive some type of remuneration for their services. Based on a sample of AmeriCorps members from three states, we identify several motivational, demographic, and individual factors that affect retention of stipended volunteers. We conclude that retention depends more on instrumental career-related factors than on altruistic motivation or meaningfulness of the service."
1164	1998	NML	09:01	Nonprofit Organizational Effectiveness: Contrasts Between Especially Effective and Less Effective Organizations	"How do key stakeholders of nonprofit organizations (NPOs) judge the effectiveness of their organization? Are the judgments of stakeholders similar, and how are board effectiveness and the use of practitioner-identified correct management procedures related to judgments of effectiveness? This study focuses on a subset of especially effective and less effective NPOs from a larger sample and finds that the especially effective have more effective boards (as judged by various stakeholder groups), have boards with higher social prestige, use more practitioner-identified correct management procedures, and use more change management strategies. Practical implications discussed include adopting more correct management procedures and change management strategies."
1165	1998	NML	09:01	Business Leaders and Nonprofits	"How do nonprofits figure into the lives of business leaders? And how do business leaders figure into the lives of nonprofits? The intersections exist but there is relatively little systematic research to document empirically this piece of the nonprofit picture. This article aims to help fill that void by presenting research results regarding the who, when, where, why, how, and so what of the involvement of businesspeople in the nonprofit sector, particularly as board members."
1166	1998	NML	09:01	The Decision-Making Context and Its Impact on Local Human Service Nonprofits	"One significant factor affecting an organization's functioning is the decisions made by other organizations that are important to it. We examine decision-making in three local human service delivery nonprofits, focusing on the level (local versus national) of the actors making decisions as well as the degree of horizontal or vertical coordination among decision makers. The findings show that the decision-making context affects nonprofit structure and operations and suggest that providers may have to make significant trade-offs as they seek to restructure in response to policy changes such as devolution."
1167	1998	NML	09:01	An Organization Design Model for Nonprofits	"This article proposes that designers of nonprofit public service organizations must get outside a two-dimensional paradigm of effectiveness and efficiency. The strength of the model is the integration of three parameters, showing how planning, productivity, and politics run through an organizational system and how these dimensions can be aligned for greater leverage. The model simplifies design and diagnosis, allowing managers to initiate change in an incremental and holistic way."
1168	1998	NML	09:02	Strengthening Board Performance	"Many nonprofit boards have undertaken board development activities, yet there has been little empirical evidence of the impact on board performance. This article reports findings from organizations: ten participated in developmental interventions, and fourteen received no interventions but served as matched comparisons. The experimental group showed significant improvements in board performance, and the comparison group did not. Lessons from the study include a number of practical steps boards can take to reorganize governance procedures and structures to enhance board effectiveness."
1169	1998	NML	09:02	"Nongovernmental Organizations, Business, and the Management of Ambiguity"	"Partnerships between business and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that seek to promote fair trade between small scale producers in poor countries and Western consumers are opening up new and potentially challenging approaches to development in terms of income generation, local capacity building, and alternative sources of NGO funding. However, such ventures face a distinctive set of problems, many of which arise because these ventures are located uncomfortably on the boundary between the nonprofit and the business sectors. The concept of sectoral ambiguity helps to explain observed problems with confused expectations, management tensions, and lack of sustainability. Strengthening these partnerships will require greater transparency, market diversification, long-range planning, and the building of a set of more realistic expectations."
1170	1998	NML	09:02	The Strength of Strong and Weak Ties	"Strong civil societies, composed of diverse community groups and nongovernmental organizations, are increasingly seen as necessary for robust economic growth and effective democratic governance. Yet financial and other resources for civil society organizations typically are scarce."
1171	1998	NML	09:02	The Influence of Ethical Reasoning on Leader Effectiveness	"In making decisions about ethical issues for their organizations, effective nonprofit executives differ substantially from ineffective nonprofit executives according to the study reported here."
1172	1998	NML	09:02	Community Development Venture Capital	The investment strategies of nine community development venture capital (CDVC) funds and their mixed results in managing the tension between financial and social returns reveal the challenges in combining traditional venture capital methods with community development goals.
1173	1999	NML	09:03	Effective Ministerial Leadership	"Ministers of local congregations are in positions somewhat similar to the chief executives of other local nonprofit organizations, except that ministers are also expected to respond to the specifically religious needs of their congregants. In this article we assess how especially effective ministers in one denomination differ from less effective ministers in both general leadership skills and specifically religious leadership skills. The especially effective ministers were identified by applying three selection methods, resulting in an unusually careful selection of a sample of especially effective leaders. The results show that the especially effective are more skillful managers, problem solvers, planners, delegators, change agents, shepherds, inspirers, multitaskers, students, and servants and demonstrate themselves to be persons of integrity."
1174	1999	NML	09:03	"Reforming Property Tax Exemption Policy in the Nonprofit Sector: Commercialism, Collective Goods, and the Donative Theory"	"This article develops, critiques, and tests the donative theory, which bases the tax treatment of nonprofits on their production of collective or public goods, through twelve variations for determining property-tax-exempt organizations in five nonprofit industry groups. Using a case study of Indianapolis nonprofits, the results reveal that a significant number of organizations in the nonprofit sector and most industry groups would experience the loss of their property tax exemption. The author calls for nonprofit managers and scholars to give greater future attention to property tax exemption policy in the nonprofit sector."
1175	1999	NML	09:03	Neighborhood-Based Services: Organizational Change and Integration Prospects	"Prospects for service integration between settlement houses, or traditional neighborhood centers that offer services for individuals ranging from preschool children to the elderly, and family resource centers, agencies that provide support for families and early childhood education programs, are explored in this Rochester, New York, case study. Although the target populations of these two types of organizations overlap, service integration is not likely in the short run due to differing organizational philosophies and the adaptation of each organization to unique funding sources. Increased funding pressures and demands for greater efficiency in service delivery may make collaboration more attractive in the future"
1176	1999	NML	09:03	Requisite Variety of Strategic Management Modes: A Cultural Study of Strategic Actions in a Deterministic Environment	"This article presents the results of a qualitative study that examines the modes by which strategy emanates in a nonprofit human services organization, externally controlled by its funding sources. The strategy-making process is broached by proposing a taxonomy of strategic modes arranged into the Hrebiniak and Joyce (1985) framework. In light of Ashby's law of requisite variety (1968), this study contends that the subject organization's context of environmental determinism should lead to a culturally based configuration of traditional, spontaneous, and dialectical modes. The results support the proposition for requisite variety. This research presents valuable implications for the study and practice of strategic management-especially regarding strategic learning and change within externally controlled nonprofit organizations."
1177	1999	NML	09:03	The Nonprofit Sector and State Governments: Public Policy Issues Facing Nonprofits in North Carolina and Other States	"The challenges facing nonprofits in North Carolina and most states include devolution and ripple effects at the state level from federal budget cutbacks, government efforts to tax or further regulate nonprofits, scandals involving a few organizations or their leaders, and efforts to limit nonprofits right to lobby and advocate for their causes. But the future also holds a number of opportunities for nonprofits, including the increased clout of nonprofits acting together as a sector; partnership initiatives with nonprofits by North Carolina's governor and chief executives in other states, legislative measures to increase charitable giving and reduce red tape, state-level summits following up on the president's push for increased volunteerism, and a reservoir of public trust in nonprofits. North Carolina's experience may predict the future dangers and opportunities in other states."
1178	1999	NML	09:04	Volunteer Participation and Withdrawal	"Volunteer behavior is often difficult to manage or control since control systems of the sort that direct behavior in most for-profit organizations are usually not available. This study introduces a tool the psychological contract that can give voluntary-agency administrators a powerful way to help them understand and manage volunteers contributions to their organizations. The study finds that elements of this approach, especially the level of support the volunteer believes he or she is receiving from the organization, are especially important tools that can both increase participation in various events and reduce withdrawal or turnover intentions."
1179	1999	NML	09:04	Using Suggested Contributions in Fundraising for Public Good	"This article presents a provision point mechanism experiment designed to investigate the impact of suggested contributions in a public-good contribution process. We find that suggesting contributions is ineffective if subjects value the public good equally. However, if valuations for the public good differ among individuals, as they do in the real world, we find that contribution suggestions increase the likelihood of providing the public good, increase the fraction of individuals contributing their suggested share, and improve the equity of the distribution of contributions."
1180	1999	NML	09:04	The Perils of Practice	"On April 27_29, 1997, Philadelphia hosted the first-ever Presidents Summit for America's Future, an historic meeting that brought unprecedented attention to volunteerism in service to the nation's young people. Based on the experience and careful analysis of a summit delegate, this article concludes that although the spotlight afforded volunteerism was helpful, the hard work to be done by the local delegations to accomplish the summit agenda is not likely to be as successful as organizers hope because of limitations in follow-up mechanisms and in the capacity and expertise of nonprofit organizations to integrate and manage volunteers effectively."
1181	1999	NML	09:04	Leaders Attitudes and Computer Use in Religious Congregations	"This study explores the attitudes of leaders of religious congregations toward computers. We uncover attitudes toward information (and thus toward computers) that are different from those reported for leaders in other organizational contexts. In short, clergy felt that systematically collecting and storing information and trying to serve as many people as possible could distract them from what is distinctive about their jobs that the job in a religious congregation is accomplished through personal rather than transactional relationships."
1182	1999	NML	09:04	Achieving Growth and High Quality by Strategic Intent	"Can nonprofits simultaneously pursue continuous rapid growth and maintain high-quality delivery of services? This article is the story of the five-year experience of one nonprofit that has attempted to apply the concept of strategic intent to its operations in pursuit of this question. The idea of continuous rapid growth seemingly dismisses the possibility of continued high quality. But in a day when expansion of quality services is needed in many segments of the nonprofit sector, the notion of the possibility of rapid growth in services with high quality is of great interest."
1183	1999	NML	10:01	Returns on Fundraising Expenditures in the Voluntary Sector	"There has been much interest of late in the relative efficiency of various forms of fundraising activity. It is the purpose of this article to establish the typical returns that might be expected to accrue from a variety of fundraising methods. Based on a postal survey of the United Kingdom's top five hundred fundraising charities, this article presents the average returns for nine different forms of fundraising. The authors also examine whether differences in returns between charities can be explained by size or sector effects."
1184	1999	NML	10:01	The Relationship Among Funding Sources for Art and History Museums	"The decline and possible elimination of federal support of the arts in the United States is likely to have a major impact on museum finances. Using data from the 1989 Survey of Museums, we analyze the interactions among major categories of museum funding. The results indicate a strong, positive stimulus of federal funding on private contributions, with some possible displacement of state and local government contributions. The opportunity to generate funds from private sources shows some promise to offset the loss of funds from government sources."
1185	1999	NML	10:01	A Better Method for Analyzing the Costs and Benefits of Fundraising at Universities	"This article develops a new methodology for a more comprehensive and useful analysis of the costs and benefits of fundraising, as well as the total costs and net benefits associated with development efforts in general. This approach does a better job of linking the timing of return of fundraising efforts and measuring the actual return on investments in fundraising (as opposed to the reported return) than the widely used guidelines from the Council for Advancement and Support of Education and the National Association of College and University Business Officers (CASE/NACUBO) (1990). The implications are a better methodology for practitioners that they can use to enhance internal decision making and a better methodology for boards to use in evaluating performance and accountability. Recently, other large, public universities have begun using several of these concepts in the assessment of their development offices (Rooney, 1998)."
1186	1999	NML	10:01	The Impact of Devolution on Nonprofits	"The following article reviews the results of a multiphase study of nonprofit social service organizations serving children and youth in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. The purpose of the study was to assess the impact of devolution and related efforts to introduce the new public management in the nonprofit sector. Study results strongly suggest that the capacity of community-based and faith-based organizations to adopt the business-oriented approach required to meet the expectations of government contracts is profoundly limited by their financial and human resources and by the conflict that a market orientation can present to the nonprofit mission."
1187	1999	NML	10:01	The Suitability and Application of Scenario Planning for National Professional Associations	This article explores the suitability of scenario development as a strategic planning tool for national professional associations. It examines strategic planning by nonprofits and how scenarios fit into the planning process. Scenario planning is shown to be a promising technique for anticipating the impact of technology and other environmental changes on professional practice. The experience of the American Health Information Management Association shows that scenarios are a useful way to communicate and gain member acceptance of the need for personal and professional change.
1188	1999	NML	10:02	The Role of Nonprofit Management Support Organizations in Sustaining Community Collaborations	"This article uses case studies to explore the theory that nonprofit management support organizations (MSOs) should consider taking on the role of convener and facilitator of community collaborations. They can do this work by facilitating planning and change and providing data to inform decisions about how to improve communities. In acting as a community support organization, their primary mission would be to build the capacity of all sectors to work together to solve social problems rather than simply to build the management capacity of individual nonprofit organizations."

The merger was undertaken as a conscious strategy to enable the newly formed Arbor Circle Corporation to cope more effectively with environmental uncertainty, especially in regard to government contracting. The successes and the struggles encountered in the merger are instructive for other nonprofits that may be contemplating this kind of organizational restructuring as well as those interested in the impact of contracting on the government-nonprofit relationship."
1190	1999	NML	10:02	Roles and Responsibilities of Community Nonprofit Boards	"In this study, roles and responsibilities associated with nonprofit boards of directors were supported by a framework inclusive of Strategic Activities, Operations, and Resource Planning roles. This framework can be valuable for paid staff and volunteers in understanding the broad scope of the work of nonprofit boards and practical applications such as agenda setting for board meetings and designing board training and development activities."
1191	1999	NML	10:02	Resisting Invisibility	"Nonprofit arts organizations often struggle for visibility and survival. They may meet these challenges by adopting new marketing strategies, forming administrative alliances with other organizations, or creating programming that appeals to broader audiences. Though these tactics are indeed important, arts organizations must first develop a persistent presence in their communities. This article proposes five key ingredients of persistent presence for nonprofit arts organizations and suggests that persistent presence can be consciously constructed by an organization, by an artistic discipline, and by the larger arts community. The intent of this exploratory framework for persistent presence may guide arts administrators in their work and propel future research in this area."
1192	1999	NML	10:02	How Should an International NGO Allocate Growth?	"PLAN International (PLAN) developed a methodology to ensure that its robust growth in the late 1980s and early 1990s was directed in a manner that was explicitly consistent with organizational strategy. This methodology enabled it to target its growth toward countries where child-related need was greater and in which its program approach was likely to have most impact. Managers of international nongovernmental organizations should find PLAN's experience relevant as they strive to strike a balance between organizational expansion, with its pressures and distractions, and the crucial need to maintain institutional focus."
1193	2000	NML	10:03	The Role of the Economic Sector in the Provision of Care to Trusting Clients	"With implications for senior care as well as child care, this article compares for-profit and nonprofit dependent-care facilities in areas of service that are not readily visible to consumers. Findings gleaned from the child-care industry indicate that nonprofit facilities provide a higher quality of service on professionally identified variables than do their for-profit counterparts. For-profit directors were more likely to implement cost efficiencies that were not immediately apparent to clients. Despite this, significantly more of the for-profits were displeased with their financial situation than were their nonprofit counterparts. The study suggests that professional background and training of directors exercises an influence on management satisfaction and decisions, independent of sector."
1194	2000	NML	10:03	The Nonprofit Sector and Gender Discrimination	"This article reports the results of an exploratory study of a cross section of nonprofit human service organizations that examined whether and to what extent a glass ceiling exists for women in this sector. The findings substantiate the existence of the glass ceiling phenomenon among the agencies studied. Men are disproportionately represented in management, particularly upper-level management, and they earn higher salaries than women at all hierarchical levels of the organization."
1195	2000	NML	10:03	The Income Gap and the Health of Arts Nonprofits	"This article addresses the widening gap between costs and revenues for many arts nonprofits, it examines the most common explanations for the problem, categorizes possible solutions, and suggests practical strategies for implementation. This study suggests that a critical difference exists between large and small arts firms, which in turn implies a different set of strategies for each. Whereas large organizations do well to leverage technological innovations, diversify product lines, and expand audiences through educational outreach, smaller organizations tend to see greater returns from efforts to expand their philanthropic base."
1196	2000	NML	10:03	Adaptive Strategies of Nonprofit Human Service Organizations in an Era of Devolution and New Public Management	"This article reviews the results of a multiphase study of nonprofit human service organizations serving children and youth in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. The purpose of the study was to identify adaptation strategies organizations found effective for the current environment. The study reviews the results of longitudinal focus groups and a final workshop directed to analyzing strategies for maintaining organizational viability. Effective adaptations included strategic expansion of services and client bases, networking as a means to acquire and stabilize revenue streams and resources, and increased use of business techniques and technology to generate outcome measures and an image of effectiveness with funders."
1197	2000	NML	10:03	A House Divided: How Nonprofits Experience Union Drives	"Drawing from forty in-depth interviews as well as personal experiences, the researchers identify the areas for argument in unionization drives among nonprofit organizations. The topic is placed in the context of the nonprofit sector's ongoing discussion of its relationship with, and distinction from, the government and business sectors."
1198	2000	NML	10:04	"Healthy Organizations, Unhealthy Communities?"	"Nonprofit organizations are an important part of local social networks that connect individuals and organizations and enhance the capacity of communities to solve social problems. However, the commercialization of nonprofit organizations influences their ability to contribute to this social capital. We reason that commercialization of a nonprofit organization may reduce its ability to contribute to social capital if it weakens its social networks, makes its network of relationships less stable, reduces the size, diversity, or involvement of its governing board, or reduces its level of voluntary participation."
1199	2000	NML	10:04	The Four C's of Government Third Sector-Government Relations	"All over the world, we see trends of increasing interaction between governments and the third sector. Is this the start of a beautiful friendship or are they already too close for comfort? This article argues that the nature of these complex relationships is poorly understood and often simplified. It proposes a four-C framework based on institutional interests and preferences for policy ends and means cooperation in the case of similar ends and similar means, confrontation in the case of dissimilar ends and dissimilar means, complementarity in the case of similar ends but dissimilar means, and co-optation in the case of dissimilar ends but similar means."
1200	2000	NML	10:04	Using Service-Customer Matrices in Strategic Analysis of Nonprofits	"This article demonstrates the value of service-customer matrices (SCMs) for managers performing strategic analysis of nonprofit organizations (NPOs). Some of the benefits of using SCMs are understanding the portfolio of businesses, clarifying what sponsors and clients value, identifying rivals, key attributes, and revenues on a service-customer segment basis, and understanding and formulating positioning strategy."
1201	2000	NML	10:04	Relating the Central and the Local	"Although a number of valuable models of central-local relationships in the nonprofit sector have been developed, particularly in relation to federal structures, there has been a tendency to assume that in any given organizational relationship central-local structures will follow one common pattern. We argue that wider strategies are available: central dependency along one dimension may run with greater local autonomy along another. Such mixed tight-loose structures may be of considerable importance in the boundaryless organizational environment of the future."
1202	2000	NML	10:04	A Collaborator Profile for Executives of Nonprofit Organizations	"This study involving ninety-two nonprofit executive directors who engaged in separate interorganizational collaborations investigated the relationship between a select number of individual characteristics (personality and demographic) and perceived collaboration outcome (successful or unsuccessful). The collaborator profile that resulted suggests that directors who are predisposed to perceiving their respective collaborations as successful are extravert, feeling males who have high role ambiguity and low role boundary occupational stress. Given the increasing need for nonprofit organizations to collaborate with other organizations, it is important for nonprofit executives and their boards to be cognizant of some key factors that can lead to successful interorganizational collaborations."
1203	2000	NML	11:01	"Should St. Merciful Hospital Become CorpHealth, Inc.?: Ownership and Quality in U.S. Health Care Organizations"	"In this article, a review of empirical research on ownership and quality of care suggests the existence of a quality gap between for-profit and nonprofit firms in some health sectors, depending on the prevailing type of financial payment for health care. Results of a theoretical model incorporating quality of care suggest that the nondistribution constraint is a simple and powerful explanation for a higher level of patient care quality at nonprofit health care facilities when reimbursement for health services is fixed prospectively. Analysis suggests that review of future conversions of health care facilities from nonprofit to for-profit status should take into consideration the implied effects of the conversion on patient outcomes."
1204	2000	NML	11:01	What Happens When Nonprofits Use Quality Models for Self-Assessment?	"Two tools to assist organizational self-assessment have recently become popular in the U.K. nonprofit sector, providing the opportunity for a comparative study of how such tools are used in practice. Because both spring from the quality movement in management, the study also provided a chance to observe how quality ideas evolve as they are applied in nonprofit contexts. The study found that self-assessment can indeed enable constructive review processes in a wide range of contexts. However, when the models work it is in rather different ways than is suggested by the terms in which they are promoted."
1205	2000	NML	11:01	The Effects of United Way Membership on Employee Pay in Nonprofit Organizations	"This research investigates the relationship between United Way membership and the compensation level of employees in nonprofit organizations. This study is based on questionnaires completed by 1,811 employees from sixty-nine nonprofit agencies in a large metropolitan area. Managerial capitalism, agency theory, and United Way funding and governance roles were used to develop the hypotheses. We found that employees of organizations belonging to the United Way receive pay premiums, suggesting that the United Way member agencies are higher-quality agencies that pay their employees higher wages."
1206	2000	NML	11:01	Sexual Orientation Discrimination and Its Challenges for Nonprofit Managers	"In the wake of the recent New Jersey Supreme Court decision, Dale v. Boy Scouts of America and Monmouth Council Boy Scouts (1999), this article examines the issue of sexual orientation discrimination and the challenges it presents nonprofit managers. Because of regional shifts in public opinion, the enactment of nondiscrimination laws at the state and local level, and now a state Supreme Court interpreting state law to include the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) as a public accommodation, nonprofit managers may face a more complex legal and moral environment. It is hoped that this article will challenge nonprofit managers to carefully reexamine their membership and personnel policies with respect to lesbians and gay men and begin preparing their organizations for this cultural change."
1207	2000	NML	11:01	Designing Agendas to Reflect Board Roles and Responsibilities: Results of a Study	"Over a nine-month period the board agendas of a community nonprofit organization were redesigned to reflect a particular board agenda tool titled Strategic Activities, Resource Planning, and Operations. Feedback from the board members and executive director indicate strong support for the framework in focusing the work of the board. The framework also has implications for how the executive director and board members prepare for meetings and how the shared leadership of the meetings is played out."
1208	2000	NML	11:02	Information and Communication Technologies: Reshaping Voluntary Organizations?	"Electronic networking holds the promise of innovation with involuntary organizations as they seek to respond to deep shifts in the social, economic, and political spheres in which they operate. Evidence from our study of U.K. voluntary organizations demonstrates relatively low uptake of the core networking technologies and applications essential to support the reconfiguration of key relationships in and around the organizations. Friends of the Earth and the Samaritans are exceptions to this trend. Case studies of these organizations suggest they are using information and communication technologies to reshape internal relationships and reconfigure relationships externally. The extent to which the organizations are reconfiguring around intelligent campaigning and intelligent client service is tempered by their long-standing values."
1209	2000	NML	11:02	Collaboration Among Rural Nonprofit Organizations	"Collaboration has received strong impetus in recent years. Service providers face greater expectations that they will share human and financial resources with other organizations, conduct joint planning, and devise other ways to break down organization barriers. This article analyzes collaborative practices among nonprofit organizations in rural southern Illinois and the Mississippi Delta. Environmental factors present in rural areas suggest that collaboration may be difficult to accomplish. Clients are scattered over a large geographic area, they are hard to contact because of transportation problems, community financial resources are limited, staff salaries are low, and some rural populations resist service offerings. Despite these difficulties, nonprofits in the two rural regions do engage in significant collaborations, and their leadership shows strong commitment to partnering with other organizations. Certain characteristics of the rural environment actually facilitate collaboration."
1210	2000	NML	11:02	Accountability in Action?: Program Evaluation in Nonprofit Human Service Agencies	"Program evaluation can be used as an excellent tool to promote nonprofit human service organizations accountability. This article lays out several conditions that need to be met before evaluation achieves its potential. Application of this framework to nonprofits in Dallas, Texas, indicates the usefulness of the approach. Results show that considerable numbers of evaluation are being conducted but that the quality of the research methods and measures is low. This indicates that evaluation cannot currently be said to be providing the level of accountability possible. Additional efforts by all stakeholders to promote the use of evaluation to hold agencies accountable for efforts and results are necessary."
1211	2000	NML	11:02	Ports of Entry and Obstacles: Teenagers Access to Volunteer Activities	"The recruitment of young people into volunteering activities is the primary focus of this article. We examine which teenagers volunteer, the ways that teenagers become involved in volunteer activities, and why teenagers do not volunteer. Teenagers who volunteer tend to have dominant status, that is, access to social power, high personal competency, and socialization into volunteer experiences through family, church, and school. Personal contact with family, friends, and teachers who are involved with service, prior participation in school- and church-based service, and personal initiative lead teenagers to learn about and engage in volunteering activities. Teenagers who do not volunteer often do not have sufficient time or interest. Differences exist among teenagers as to which factors prompt volunteering. For example, teenagers who are white, have parents who volunteer, and attend religious services are more likely than others to learn about volunteer activities through organizations, and teenagers with higher personal competency (grade point averages) are more likely than others to learn about volunteering activities at school. The article includes suggestions for recruitment policy and management of teenage volunteers."
1212	2000	NML	11:02	Predicting the Financial Vulnerability of Charitable Organizations	"This article describes a model that can be used to predict which nonprofit organizations are vulnerable to financial problems. The model is based on financial indicators developed by Tuckman and Chang (1991), adapts methodologies that have been developed in the for-profit sector to predict financial vulnerability, and was empirically tested using a multiyear Internal Revenue Service database provided by the National Center for Charitable Statistics. Both internal and external stakeholders can use the model when making allocation decisions during the strategic planning process and in evaluating financial risk."
1213	2000	NML	11:02	A Strategic Planning Process for a Small Nonprofit Organization: A Hospice Example	"Strategic planning is an essential part of management. However, planning processes can consume great amounts of time and resources that small, nonprofit organizations may lack. Moreover, the process that is used can be tedious and may result in plans that are discarded before or during their implementation. In this article, a strategic planning process is presented that incorporates a Policy Delphi group technique and Situation Structuring, a computer program that assists participants in structuring or defining the problems to be addressed in the plan. The organization to which the process is applied is a small, nonprofit hospice. Both the planning process and an evaluation of the implementation of the resultant strategic plan are examined"
1214	2001	NML	11:03	Are We at the Cutting Edge or the Blunt Edge?: Improving NGO Organizational Performance with Private and Public Sector Strategic Management Frameworks	"Bankruptcy or irrelevance are likely paths for not-for-profit organizations (NGOs) that do not reshape themselves to achieve greater impact, efficiency, and accountability in an increasingly global, competitive environment. But how relevant are public and private sector management frameworks for NGO repositioning? This article provides initial answers through a case study of CARE, one of the largest international relief and development nonprofit organizations in the United States. It explores the transformation frameworks employed at CARE between 1992 and 1997, assesses what worked and what did not, and identifies initial lessons learned for the broader sector."
1215	2001	NML	11:03	"Enterprise Schemes for Nonprofit Survival, Growth, and Effectiveness"	"The need for nonprofit organizations to develop a viable enterprise scheme is discussed in this article. An enterprise scheme indicates how the organization can meet social needs and stakeholders interests in a self-sustaining way over the long haul. Without a viable enterprise scheme, the organization will not survive, let alone grow, prosper, and achieve its mission."
1216	2001	NML	11:03	Organizational Identity and the Structure of Nonprofit Umbrella Associations	"This article applies the concept of organizational identity to the structural issues faced by national and international nonprofit umbrella associations. Such associations grapple with several possible self-concepts, including goal-seeking systems, economies, and polities . Two associations CIVICUS and Girls Incorporated are studied in depth. Consensus around a clear identity is found to be a key factor in resolving the structural dilemmas of these associations."
1217	2001	NML	11:03	Reinventing a Large Nonprofit: Lessons from Four Voluntary Health Associations	"This article describes attempts by four voluntary health associations to obtain their member organizations consent to an emphasis on national rather than local goals and to new structures that centralized the members management and governance functions while keeping service delivery decentralized. It argues that at three of the four associations, the member organizations agreed to a restructuring because the national organizations won their trust through a broadly inclusive decision-making process and because the members were persuaded that the restructuring would increase resources available for local programs and services. Although the shift in focus to national goals risks diminishing local support, the reorganizations are evidence of a broadly felt need in nonprofit associations for a new decision-making model and for new roles for volunteers that take better advantage of their community relationships."
1218	2001	NML	11:03	Managing Multisite Nonprofits	"Multisite nonprofit systems are organized in a variety of ways, ranging from central control to local control. Regardless of where a system falls along this organizational continuum, inevitable tensions emerge in the relationship between headquarters and the local organization. The purpose of this article is to understand the causes of these tensions and to offer management action that, regardless of the organizational structure, leads to greater system cohesion. Our exploration was facilitated by intense field research at five multisite systems: Outward Bound USA, Planned Parenthood, Habitat for Humanity, SOS Kinderdorf, and The Nature Conservancy. Our investigation suggests that multisite system behavior may be mapped on two dimensions one that exerts forces toward unit autonomy and the other influencing the degree of organizational affiliation. These forces are associated with a host of organizational functions that are the traditional domains of management to influence and shape and thereby enable a multisite nonprofit to simultaneously optimize the benefits of organizational affiliation and unit autonomy."
1219	2001	NML	11:03	Lessons for Multisite Nonprofits from the United Church of Christ	This article describes the restructuring process currently underway at the United Church of Christ (UCC)a 1.4 million member Protestant denomination. Three main questions are addressed: What are the central goals of the UCC restructure? What factors might explain the particular strategic direction pursued in UCC restructuring? and How might the UCC case inform recent thinking about the structure and performance of multisite nonprofits?
1220	2001	NML	11:03	Strategic Performance Measurement and Management in Nonprofit Organizations	"The managers and constituents of nonprofits are increasingly concerned about measuring and managing organizational performance. Financial measures alone, or even supplemented with a collection of ad hoc nonfinancial measures, are not sufficient to motivate and evaluate mission accomplishments. This article describes the adaptation of a new performance measurement and management approach, the Balanced Scorecard, to the nonprofit sector. Several examples of actual implementation are provided."
1221	2001	NML	11:03	Mission Impossible?: Measuring Success in Nonprofit Organizations	"The difficulty of measuring performance in the nonprofit sector has long been recognized. This article begins with a case study detailing how one organization, The Nature Conservancy, tackled the challenge of moving beyond measuring activity to measuring mission impact. After several false starts, the Conservancy developed a model for measuring success, divided into three broad areas: impact, activity, and capacity. The article then presents data from interviews with leaders of thirty other leading nonprofits, who reveal how their organizations measure performance in these three areas. It concludes with some lessons learned about performance measurement in the nonprofit sector."
1222	2001	NML	11:04	Improving the Quality of Outcome Evaluation Plans	"Nonprofit agencies are struggling to meet new funder demands in outcome evaluation. This study is the first of its kind to examine factors that contribute to agency progress in this area. Path analysis is used to examine chains of influence among five predictors of success as well as three control variables. Study findings indicate that agency culture, technology, management support, and involvement are key predictors of quality. Nonprofit managers who want to succeed in the new era of accountability should consider the potential impact of these factors on the quality of outcome evaluation plans in their agencies."
1223	2001	NML	11:04	Attitude Differences Between Paid Workers and Volunteers	"This study addresses the extension of research on paid employees to volunteer workers. Pearce (1978, 1993b) has postulated that job attitudes are substantially different between volunteers and paid employees, based on her work studying fourteen organizations employing either entirely volunteer workgroups or entirely paid workgroups. Another interpretation of her data would be that the organizational culture of such workgroups is different, not the individual job attitudes"
1224	2001	NML	11:04	"The Who, Why, and How of Reinvention in Nonprofit Organizations"	"Although reinvention of government agencies is being extensively discussed, relatively little is known about the reinvention strategies of nonprofit organizations. This article reports survey results for a randomly selected group of nonprofit organizations from across the United States. We conclude that reinvention is being used as a management tool by nonprofit organizations and that it is affecting day-to-day operations. Regardless of how reinvention was implemented, these organizations generally view their reinvention activities as successful for increasing productivity, enhancing services, improving performance, and managing costs."
1225	2001	NML	11:04	Local Unit Performance in a National Nonprofit Organization	"Board members and chief professional officers (CPOs) from the local units of a national nonprofit organization completed questionnaires that revealed (1) statistically significant differences as to what functions and activities each believes the other should do and does perform, (2) areas of possible tension between boards and their CPOs, and (3) those activities with significant correlations to common performance measures established by the national organization. Both board members and CPOs believe boards should be doing more than they do, with CPOs being more critical of board members than they are of themselves or than board members are of them. There is significant tension between boards and CPOs regarding responsibility for some operational issues. However, neither the presence nor absence of tension was significantly correlated with the effectiveness of the organization. Finally, self-reported measures of effectiveness correlated with external measures developed by the national organization, providing some evidence that self-reported measures may be valid."
1226	2001	NML	11:04	Tackling Fragmentation and Building Unity in an International Nongovernmental Organization	"Growth and decentralization have brought increasing conflict to many international NGOs, particularly between field and headquarters. This case study, written by the executive responsible for the activities portrayed, examines an attempt to define a clear new role for a headquarters department in a large, decentralized INGO focused on building unity of purpose. By ensuring that decentralized units of the organization took the leadership in related corporate initiatives whenever possible, with headquarters coordinating an inclusive process rather than implementing, unity was increased and tension reduced. Senior managers at the headquarters of growing, decentralized INGOs should find this case study relevant as they strive to maintain unity in the face of institutional fragmentation."
1227	2001	NML	12:01	Community Foundations: A Growing Resource for Community Development	"Like many nonprofit organizations, community development corporations (CDCs) rely on various sources of funding and support for their activities in poor and distressed neighborhoods. Funders often include the federal government, state and local government agencies, financial institutions, and philanthropic organizations. The author explains how community foundations are different from other philanthropic organizations and describes the various mechanisms that community foundations use to support community development. She suggests that there is a natural fit between the purpose of community foundations and the philosophy of community development, concluding that it is important for CDCs, as well as other nonprofit organizations, to understand how community foundations are different from other philanthropic organizations so that they may better position themselves to take advantage of the many resources that community foundations bring to their communities."
1228	2001	NML	12:01	Using Donor Lifetime Value to Inform Fundraising Strategy	"The successful quantification in monetary terms of the value of a donor to a voluntary organization can be a valuable aid to the subsequent development of fundraising strategy. Despite the significance of the concept of lifetime value (LTV), however, many nonprofits remain uncertain as to exactly how it might be calculated. This article reviews the contribution that LTV can make to fundraising and provides a conceptual framework within which it might be calculated."
1229	2001	NML	12:01	Ethical Climate in Nonprofit Organizations: Propositions and Implications	"The authors discuss a number of variables that may influence the perception of ethical climate in the nonprofit sector, including individual, organizational, and significant other (peers, coworkers, and superiors) variables. The basis of this discussion is the model developed by Agarwal and Malloy (1999) identifying a framework for nonprofits that is distinct from the for-profit orientation. The authors provide ten propositions and discuss their implications."
1230	2001	NML	12:01	Effective Contracting of Social Services	"The continued growth in the use of privatization for the delivery of social services increases the need for a systematic method to analyze the contracting process. Using a modified form of the basic systems model, the authors examine the impact of antecedents and situational factors and explore the use of traditional management steps in the contracting process. The authors focus on one state's experience with contracting to explore the implications of such a model."
1231	2001	NML	12:01	Accounting for Social Value in Nonprofits and For-Profits	"The authors argue that social value can serve as a bridge between the nonprofit and for-profit sectors. They further propose that social value is not simply an abstract concept but can be measured by applying social accounting methods. The authors argue that nonprofits are founded on a social mission but that traditional accounting approaches do not properly assess their social products. They illustrate the centrality of social value, both to nonprofits and for-profits, in two ways: (1) a discussion of for-profit firms that behave much like nonprofits and (2) an application of the social accounting model. The authors discuss two types of firms: (1) for-profits whose shares are held in a trust and therefore operate much like corporations without shareholders or like nonprofits and (2) for-profits whose owners do not exercise the rights associated with their property. They then apply a social accounting model to nonprofit employment training programs to illustrate how the inclusion of social variables changes the assessment of an organization's value. They conclude with a discussion of a social accountability framework that embraces both nonprofits and for-profits."
1232	2001	NML	12:02	Who Are the Alumni Donors? Giving by Two Generations of Alumni from Selective Colleges	"Using data on former students of fourteen private colleges and universities, this paper examines patterns of alumni giving. The data are taken from the College and Beyond survey, which covers individuals who entered the institutions in the fall of 1951, 1976, and 1989. Contributions by these former students to these colleges and universities tend to be quite concentrated, with half of all donations being given by the most generous 1 percent of the sample. A higher level of contribution is associated with higher income, with having participated in extracurricular activities in college, with having had a mentor in college, and with the degree of satisfaction in one's undergraduate experience. The projected donations for the most generous of these alumni over the course of a lifetime are quite high, with totals for the 1951 cohort exceeding those from the 1976 cohort."
1233	2001	NML	12:02	Organizational Identity in Nonprofit Organizations: Strategic and Structural Implications	"Organizational identity is what is central, distinctive, and enduring about an organization. This article argues that clarity and consensus about organizational identity are essential elements in setting successful long-term strategy and making structural choices in a nonprofit organization. Four classes of nonprofit organization are examined here: grantmaking foundations, federated fundraising organizations, nonprofit academic centers, and social enterprises. In each case, alternative identities are described and the implications of each identity for organizational strategy and structure are analyzed. The article suggests that examination of identity should become an integral part of organizational development for nonprofit organizations and a subject for continued research."
1234	2001	NML	12:02	Leadership in Collaborative Community Health Partnerships	"This article examines key leadership issues in community health partnerships. We assert that leadership in a partnership is differentiated from that in a traditional, hierarchical organization in that participation is voluntary and egalitarian and often entails cooperation by organizations with different cultures and agendas. Partnership leaders, accordingly, often lack formal control over members and their actions. Using qualitative analysis of 115 site-visit interviews of participants in four partnerships in the Community Care Networks demonstration program, we identify and discuss five themes of collaborative leadership: systems thinking, vision-based leadership, collateral leadership, power sharing, and process-based leadership. We then discuss the multiple challenges that collaborative leadership faces in a community health partnership."
1235	2001	NML	12:02	Relationship Fundraising: How to Keep Donors Loyal	"This article explores how relationship marketing and its variant relationship fundraising may be used to assist nonprofits in reducing the lapse rate of donors to their organization. Employing a postal survey of ten thousand donors to causes in a variety of categories, the author concludes that although approximately one in five donors might lapse because of a change in financial circumstances, a similar number simply elect to switch their support to other organizations. The role of the quality of service offered to the donor in enhancing retention is also highlighted, as are donor perceptions of the feedback they receive and the impact they believe their gift might have on the cause."
1236	2001	NML	12:02	Repeal of the Estate Tax and Its Impact on Philanthropy	"The estate tax has many advocates and opponents. We present a review of the primary arguments and empirical evidence promulgated in support of continuation and for repeal. Overall, we find that there are plausible theories and strong, but not definitive, empirical evidence on both sides of the issue. Further research is needed that more clearly isolates differences between the income-tax and estate-tax (that is, the after-tax cost or price of a donation or bequest) effects, the independent-income and wealth effects (how having higher income or wealth has an effect on giving during life and at death), and married and single estate tax filers. These differences can be best isolated using longitudinal data. Data and analyses for both the short run and long run are necessary before society can reasonably predict the impact the repeal of the estate tax will have on both giving during life and charitable bequests."
1237	2002	NML	12:03	Using Advertising Constructs and Methods to Understand Direct Mail Fundraising Appeals	"This study examined whether we could use a Solicitation Response Model adapted from the consumer research literature to increase our understanding of nonprofit direct mail solicitations. We sent 389 surveys to people listed in the database of a homeless shelter. In response, 166 people rated an envelope and appeal from the shelter. The model successfully explained potential donors intention to open the envelope and intention to donate. Emotional responses to the envelope and attitude toward the envelope were more important influences upon acquisition (or new) donors intention to open the envelope than upon renewal donors intention. Attitude toward the appeal had a stronger effect upon acquisition donors intention to donate than it did upon renewal donors intention. The study suggests differences in the way that appeals should be designed for acquisition and renewal donors. As well, we present a small sample method for diagnosing direct mail charitable solicitations."
1238	2002	NML	12:03	Outcomes Assessment and the Paradox of Nonprofit Accountability	"Leaders of nonprofit organizations face a particular bind in responding to the demands for results-based accountability. If they focus only on the project-level outcomes over which they have the most control or for which indicators are readily available, they risk default on the larger question of accountability to publicly valued goals. On the other hand, if they try to demonstrate the impact of their particular projects on community wide outcomes, they risk taking credit inappropriately or shouldering the blame for indicators beyond their control. Here, I present findings from a research project, conducted in collaboration with economic development organizations on the north coast of California, that explored the practical demands and dynamics associated with this paradox. The key challenges are more civic and political than technical."
1239	2002	NML	12:03	The Capacity of Community-Based Organizations to Lead Local Innovations in Welfare Reform: Early Findings from Texas	"Community-based organizations (CBOs) are now cast among the lead actors in welfare reform. But do they have adequate capacity to perform this critical leadership function? Early findings from fifteen state-funded projects in Texas show that state planners must carefully assess the capacity of a CBO to initiate and sustain an innovation at the local level. The authors examine six organizational variables that predict success or failure: goals, management, technology, funding, community involvement, and performance."

"In increasing numbers, academic programs across the country are exploring how they can best meet the needs of nonprofit organizations. To better support the debate and decision-making processes of such programs, the author contributes information on training drawn from nearly six hundred nonprofit administrators, exploring variables that may influence the needs and examining the format for training most desired by those administrators."
1241	2002	NML	12:03	The Uniqueness of Nonprofit Finance and the Decision to Borrow	"Previous studies of nonprofit capital structure (borrowing relative to assets) support contradictory decision models of borrowing, but with no control for an endowment effect, which this article shows to be an important factor in the decision to borrow. Well-endowed nonprofits borrow more relative to their physical assets. When endowment and investment income are backed out of the data, nonprofits are seen to optimize the balance between debt and physical assets."
1242	2002	NML	12:03	"Internal Controls in Nonprofit Organizations: The Case of the American Cancer Society, Ohio Division"	"The authors present a case study of what went wrong in the Ohio Division of the American Cancer Society in the late 1990s, leading to massive fraud. They discuss conditions that allowed the fraud to go undetected for several years and make recommendations for creating internal control systems to keep other nonprofits from facing this type of loss."
1243	2002	NML	12:04	Into the Fire: Boards and Executive Transitions	"Managing the transition an organization undergoes when one chief executive leaves and another is hired is both a defining responsibility and one of the most critical jobs a governing board faces. CompassPoint Nonprofit Services, which consulted to twenty-eight organizations going through such transitions, found that three characteristic threats to successful transitions for nonprofit boards emerged: (1) boards underestimate the risks and costs of bad hires, (2) boards are typically unprepared for the task, and (3) boards too often focus on the problems in hiring new CEOs and fail to make full use of the opportunities in CEO transitions. This article describes the development of services to help organizations in transition, gives results from the first two years of work, and offers suggestions for support to boards and for future research."
1244	2002	NML	12:04	Toward an Understanding of Founder's Syndrome: An Assessment of Power and Privilege Among Founders of Nonprofit Organizations	"On the subject of stewardship, Block (1996, p. 47) writes, Stewardship not only affects the use of power, but it also confronts the way we hold privilege. He also states, Holding on to privilege is an act of self-interest, the antithesis of service and stewardship. As Block uses it, the term privilege denotes a class structure within governance settings, and self-interest refers to using one's power (through the exercise of privilege) to ascertain an objective that may not be in accord with others."
1245	2002	NML	12:04	Inclusive Governance Practices in Nonprofit Organizations and Implications for Practice	"An inclusive board seeks information from multiple sources, demonstrates an awareness of the community and constituents that benefit from and contribute to the organization's services, and establishes policies and structures to foster stakeholder contributions. This research investigated the prevalence of inclusive governance practices and its relationship to board composition, diversity attitudes, and recruitment practices. Fifty-six executive directors and forty-three board members representing sixty-two nonprofit organizations returned a mailed survey (29 percent response rate). The study profiled two organizations that represented different styles of inclusive governance. The survey, part of a larger study, contained questions about inclusive practices, board composition, attitudes toward diversity, and recruitment practices. Most organizations indicated that they operate with inclusive governance practices. The organizational profiles provide a picture of boards that used different strategies to accomplish the goal of inclusivity. Boards that use more inclusive practices were not necessarily heterogeneous in board member composition. Inclusive boards were more inclined to be sensitive to diversity issues and used recommended board recruitment practices. The existence of a task force or committee on diversity was also significantly associated with a more inclusive board. Nonprofit organizations must consider their philosophy on stakeholder involvement, recognizing that different strategies lead to different levels of stakeholder involvement."
1246	2002	NML	12:04	Training Policy Governance in Nonprofit Boards of Directors: The Views of Trainer-Consultants	"Although scholars widely discuss John Carver's (1990) Policy Governance model for nonprofit organizations, they have conducted little formal research on the implementation of the model. For this study, the researchers surveyed ninety-two trainer-consultants who graduated from Carver's Policy Governance Academy. The goal was to learn three things from their experiences: (1) whether trainer-consultants maintain the model as a coherent whole or teach only parts of it, (2) what they perceive as the major challenges for nonprofit boards in implementing the Policy Governance model, and (3) what contextual factors, if any, they feel affect implementation of the model across nonprofit boards with different characteristics. Survey responses indicated that (1) consultants predominantly teach the model as a whole, (2) particular policy areas appear to be problematic for nonprofit boards of directors that implement the model, and (3) two contextual factors may negatively affect the ability of a board of directors to successfully implement Policy Governance boards larger than fifteen members, and organizations with no hierarchy, where the board also functions as staff. Overall, consultants responses indicated that they feel Policy Governance is far superior to other models, but they recognize the problems and challenges that boards face in trying to implement it."
1247	2002	NML	12:04	Board Accountability: Lessons from the Field	"Accountability has become a major issue in the nonprofit sector. Numerous external and internal approaches to strengthening performance in this area exist, and many nonprofit boards expect their executives to account for use of their organizations resources. However, few boards apply any such expectations to themselves. Qualitative analysis of records from interviews, consultations, and meeting observations with 169 board members of thirty-four diverse nonprofit organizations revealed six sets of practices that foster board accountability. They include setting clear expectations and standards for the group and for its members, actively using policies regarding conflicts of interests, identifying and staying focused on priorities, maintaining strong two-way communications directly with constituency groups, conducting assessments of meetings and board performance, and experimenting intentionally with new approaches to their work. The experiences of these boards provide numerous examples of practical steps that others may consider when they seek to increase the value they add to their organizations as well as to strengthen public trust."
1248	2002	NML	12:04	The Board as a Monitor of Organizational Activity: The Applicability of Agency Theory to Nonprofit Boards	"Monitoring, as an important function for boards of directors in both the private and nonprofit sectors, receives widespread attention throughout the empirical (Chait, Holland, and Taylor, 1996, Eisenhardt, 1989, Golden-Biddle and Rao, 1997, Kosnik, 1987) and normative literature (Axelrod, 1994, Block, 1998, Carver, 1997, Houle, 1997, Ingram, 1989). Despite the consensus about the significance of this crucial board responsibility, scholars know little about the ways in which a nonprofit board actually performs its monitoring function. In this article I report on an empirical study of the monitoring behavior of twelve nonprofit boards of directors. Agency theory provides the framework for this analysis. I show that the way in which individual board members define their relationship with the chief executive and understand the scope of the monitoring function influences how, or if, they monitor agency action. The findings also show that, given ambiguous rules of accountability and unclear measures of performance, nonprofit board members tend to monitor in ways that reflect their professional or personal competencies rather than paying attention to measures that would indicate progress toward mission-related goals and initiatives."
1249	2002	NML	12:04	Change and Continuity in the Governance of Nonprofit Organizations in the United Kingdom: The Impact of Organizational Size	"This article reports on the results of a survey of charities in England and Wales, which examined how their boards are changing and whether various external initiatives to improve board performance are having an effect. In particular, the research explored the impact of organizational size. The findings suggest that the size of the organization does matter, as a variety of board characteristics and changes vary with size. The article concludes by examining some of the implications of these findings for theory and practice."
1250	2002	NML	12:04	Reframing Board-Staff Relations: Exploring the Governance Function Using a Storytelling Metaphor	"This article attempts to reframe board-staff relations by presenting an alternative perspective on governance, management, and leadership functions within nonprofit organizations. It draws on an interpretative view of organizations and suggests that we can understand nonprofits as socially constructed entities by using the metaphor of storytelling. Seeing the role of board and staff through this theoretical lens allows us to reconceptualize them. This in turn enables us to enhance the creative potential of the governance function and allows governance to support the goal of creating resilient, adaptive, learning organizations."
1251	2002	NML	13:01	Artists as Amateurs and Volunteers	"Scholarship on U.S. arts labor has generally focused only on professional artists. However, a large portion of the arts labor force is unpaid. This article takes the first steps toward characterizing both groups simultaneously and uses General Social Survey data (Davis, Smith, and Marsden, 1999) to build probabilistic portraits of active arts participation. Significant predictors of arts activity are race, region of residence, age, attendance at arts events, political ideology, gender, income, and education. These results have implications for cultural policy and future research on arts activity, especially that focusing on amateurs."
1252	2002	NML	13:01	Revisiting the Prediction of Financial Vulnerability	"Whether or not a nonprofit organization is vulnerable to financial problems is a concern of all stakeholders of the organization. Recently, Greenlee and Trussel (2000) and Trussel and Greenlee (2001) expanded Tuckman and Chang's work (1991) to predict which organizations are financially vulnerable. This article extends the work of these authors by developing a model of financial vulnerability that includes four financial indicators, controls for the sector to which an organization belongs, and is based on a sample of over ninety-four thousand organizations. The model is useful as a screening, monitoring, and attention-getting device."
1253	2002	NML	13:01	Using Economic Theory and Research to Better Understand Volunteer Behavior	"The literature on the determinants of volunteering for nonprofit organizations is highly complex, and noconceptual model has received general support (Winniford, Carpenter, and Grider, 1997). Researchers often cite the huge economic impact that nonprofit organizations have on the economy as a whole. However, they seldom mention the small but potentially important body of research on the determinants of the supply of volunteer labor that appears in the economics literature. he purpose of this article is to outline some of the economic arguments used to explain the determinants of volunteering and point out some cases where they may support other theories and concepts concerning the determinants of volunteering."
1254	2002	NML	13:01	Should We Have Faith in Faith-Based Social Services? Rhetoric Versus Realistic Expectations	"Early in his administration, President George W. Bush set forth his Faith-Based Initiative, which would authorize and encourage religious groups to compete for and provide publicly funded social services. This article analyzes the arguments made by supporters of faith-based social services in regard to their underlying values and premises. This analysis forms the basis for examining the managerial track record of faith-based organizations in the delivery of social services. To identify issues and trends within this category of service providers, the authors analyzed press reports of instances of wrong doing in faith-based groups from 1995 to 2001. Findings reveal that faith-based groups appear to be as susceptible to managerial and accountability inadequacies, if not outright wrongdoing, as are nonsectarian service providers. The authors identify implications regarding the credibility of faith-based groups and public trust as they pertain to an enhanced role in the less regulated service system that the president envisions."
1255	2002	NML	13:01	Organization and Management in the Third Sector: Toward a Cross-Cultural Research Agenda	"Third sector organizations in the industrialized and the developing world and particularly the subset of third sector organizations known as development nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)are becoming more culturally diverse in internal staff composition, management styles, and working environments. Although cultural issues have been largely absent from the nonprofit and the NGO research literatures, the organizational implications of societal culture and organizational culture are widely debated within other research fields. This article proposes a closer engagement between third sector management research and the wider study of cross-cultural organizational issues within anthropology, development studies, and management theory. It argues that such an exchange is necessary if third sector organizational research agendas are to include changing organizational landscapes effectively, and the article concludes with some ideas for future research."
1256	2002	NML	13:02	Is Corporate Engagement an Advocacy Strategy for NGOs?: The Community Aid Abroad Experience	"This article focuses on the question of whether corporate engagement can be used as an advocacy strategy for international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The article will explore some of the characteristics of corporate engagement by studying the corporate engagement experience of the Australian NGO Community Aid Abroad (CAA) in its program, the Mining Campaign. The risks that emerged for CAA from policy decisions and processes within the development of the campaign are of central concern."
1257	2002	NML	13:02	Factors Influencing Women Entrepreneurs of NGOs in India	"This article examines women entrepreneurs in the nonprofit sector. Entrepreneurial activity attracts certain kinds of individuals. Such self-selection is not a random event but is influenced by personal characteristics as well as socioeconomic and cultural factors. This article examines women entrepreneurs in a particular segment of the nonprofit sector in India to determine which factors influence such self-selection. Our research confirms findings by other scholars that nonprofit entrepreneurs receive a high payoff from promoting social causes. Furthermore, we find that previous experience in the sector, beliefs, culture, social class, education, and family background also play an important role. We explore some policy implications of our findings."
1258	2002	NML	13:02	Self-Help Groups in the Welfare State: Treatment Program or Voluntary Action?	"This article identifies two different perspectives used when studying self-help groups: the professional treatment perspective and the voluntary action perspective. An outline of the perspectives leads to a discussion of their consequences for self-help group research. The authors categorize about five hundred scientific publications from all over the world on the basis of the perspectives they present on self-help groups, the results indicate that different perspectives seem to be preferred in different countries and when discussing different subjects. Finally, the authors suggest questions and concepts that the perspectives generate, and they emphasize the importance of being aware of which perspective is used in the study of self-help groups."
1259	2002	NML	13:02	The Urge to Merge: A Multiple-Case Study	"The authors undertook a comparative study of three recent mergers of nonprofit organizations in a Midwestern urban center, within the context of political-economy theory. The research explored the impact of the same environmental factor, managed care, on the initial decisions by organizational leaders and the effects of these early decisions on subsequent actions taken to implement the merger. The study tested the authors model of the motivations for merging, which proposes that the relationship between the decision-making style of the leadership and the internal and external resources of the prospective partners determines whether the merger is driven primarily by mission, practicality, stability, or fear. Although the findings provide initial support for the hypotheses derived from the model, a demonstration of the differences in the approach to the merger by each organization indicated that other factors emerged as important driving forces during the various phases of the process."
1260	2002	NML	13:02	Passive Support: No Support at All?	"Several scholars have pointed out a shift from classic secondary associations to tertiary organizations based on passive support in Western countries. This development necessitates a better understanding of passive support within social science and voluntary sector management, on which strong opinions are expressed in the literature. This article attempts to contribute to the empirical basis for such opinions. We suggest that the current anxieties concerning the future of democracy if activity rates drop may be exaggerated."
1261	2003	NML	13:03	Determinants of executive compensation in small business development centers	"We develop and test a model of nonprofit executive compensation based on theories of organizational science, economics, and agency theory. Our sample consisted of 114 directors of small business development centers in the United States. Consistent with our model, we find significant effects for human capital, organizational size, and organizational affiliation. We find tentative support for a significant pay-for-performance relationship. We find that when education, tenure, size, performance, and affiliation are held constant, female executives are compensated significantly less than male executives."
1262	2003	NML	13:03	The ecology of games between public policy and private action: Nonprofit community organizations as bridging and mediating institutions	"The conception of nonprofit organizations as institutional bridges that mediate within an environment of interrelationships is a useful device for informing strategic thinking by nonprofit professionals and volunteers. The bridge metaphor neatly explains not only the rise in number of nonprofit community organizations, but also the process by which leaders of the private and public sectors have formed partnerships to project the wealth and assets of communities."
1263	2003	NML	13:03	German welfare organizations and the process of European integration	"The process of European integration affects an increasing number of areas of life. The influence of the European single market on the social sector, including organizations providing human services, can no longer be denied. This article looks at the activities of the European Commission toward these organizations and argues that European regulations are relevant to the German system of social service delivery due to the introduction of market-like features in the national context. Within this context, German welfare organizations have discovered an important field of interest representation and lobbying."
1264	2003	NML	13:03	The role of county-based funders in sustaining nonprofits within rural and urbanized counties	"Social service nonprofit organizations in the United States originally relied on private donations and charitable events to sustain their operations. Using case studies, this article examines the role played by local officials in the thirty-year survival of certain Indiana Youth Services Bureaus (YSBs) and highlights the salient factors that influenced the viability of some nonprofit organizations over the others."
1265	2003	NML	13:03	The economics of performance management in nonprofit organizations	"This article analyzes whether and how private-sector notions of performance management apply to nonprofit organizations. To this end the author shows that each concept of performance management used in the private sector is based on a specific economic theory of the firm and its environment. Before transferring concepts and tools derived from a certain model of the firm and its environment to nonprofit organizations, one must determine whether the assumptions underlying this model are also adequate for nonprofit organizations. Otherwise, one must first adjust those assumptions and analyze whether the derived concepts and tools are still meaningful in the new context, if not, one must determine how to modify them accordingly. The analysis elaborates on the differences between for-profit and nonprofit organizations that are important for applying performance management concepts. Moreover, the author discusses the practical implications for the use of balanced scorecards in nonprofits."
1266	2003	NML	13:04	Social accounting for nonprofits: Two models	"After giving an overview of the development of social accounting, this article presents two models of social accounting for nonprofits: the community social return on investment model and the expanded value-added statement. The discussion focuses on the process for establishing a comparative market value for nonmarket social outputs. The authors discuss these models and the comparative market value in relation to social accounting, an academic field that has evolved as part of a critique of financial accounting, especially its failure to analyze the impact of the organization on society and the natural environment. For the most part, scholars have not related social accounting to nonprofits. This article attempts to draw nonprofits into the field of social accounting. Both models address the social impact of nonprofits by including social inputs and outputs that accounting statements normally exclude."
1267	2003	NML	13:04	Scaling up CBOs for second-order devolution in welfare reform	"The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996 created a paradigm shift in the financing, organization, and delivery of welfare programs in the United States. The act shifted revenue and authority to states, giving them great discretion to determine the specifics of their programs. First-order devolution, combined with time limits and work requirements, set in motion a chain of events that moved Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) recipients into the labor force and off state welfare rolls. Second-order devolution shifted revenue and authority to community-based organizations (CBOs) to help former recipients remain employed, advance to higher paying jobs, and move their families toward economic self-sufficiency. Early findings from project innovations in Texas and other states raise doubts about the capacity of these organizations to achieve these goals. State funders will need to provide ongoing technical assistance and support to scale up the capacity of CBOs to plan, implement, and manage local innovations in welfare reform."
1268	2003	NML	13:04	Financial control in religious organizations: A status report	"Several recent high profile cases of financial mismanagement in religious organizations have highlighted the need for all religious nonprofit organizations (NPOs) to have strong internal accounting controls. These organizations are often small, rely on a great deal of volunteer support, and as a result may not have the professional oversight to adequately monitor the resources of the organization or the behavior of its leaders. The purpose of this article is to assess the current state of financial control for one segment of religious NPOs, churches, and give some suggestions for improvement. In this study over 530 churches of widely varying sizes responded to an extensive survey about specific internal controls they may or may not have in place. The results are assessed in light of preferred practices. Readers can use this information to strengthen current practices and provide a greater level of assurance that an organization is directing its resources toward its mission."
1269	2003	NML	13:04	Nonprofit organization financial performance measurement: An evaluation of new and existing financial performance measures	"Consensus about financial performance measurement remains elusive for nonprofit organization (NPO) researchers and practitioners alike, due in part to an overall lack of empirical tests of existing and new measures. The purpose of the current study was to explore potential similarities of financial performance measures derived from two sources: current NPO research and key informant interviews with NPO foundation constituencies. The authors examined financial performance measurement ratios with data from fifteen Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 990 line items. Using factor analytic techniques, they found three performance factors, each with two associated financial measurement ratios, to be present. They categorized the performance factors as fundraising efficiency, public support, and fiscal performance. This article discusses implications of the findings and future research."
1270	2003	NML	13:04	"Small, minority-based nonprofits in the information age"	"Pundits of information technology stress that the Internet opens new arenas for nonprofits through the ability to share information both locally and globally. New technology also changes funders and other evaluators expectations regarding proposals. Although new technology makes life easier for organizations with budgets, time, and familiarity with technology to buy and use these new tools, nonprofits that lack these resources fall even further behind in their quest to support and improve their programs. Based on ethnographic research in Kenosha, Wisconsin, this article explores the role of changing technology in the ability of small nonprofits to succeed in implementing their organizational mission. Using case studies, this article compares the experience of nonprofits and church mission projects based in the African American and Latino communities in this small city to that of two mainstream organizations in gaining funding and the general perception of those agencies in the local community. The article argues that expectations about the use of technology increase the gaps between a community's haves and have-nots. Kenosha organizations based in communities of color are particularly at risk due to already low funding and lack of staff familiar with new technologies. The article demonstrates that the key is often not access to technology or technical assistance but the time to make the best use of available technology."
1271	2003	NML	13:04	Performance evaluations of for-profit and nonprofit U.S. hospitals since 1980	"This synthesis of studies examines whether the published literature shows an evidence-based consensus on performance differences between private for-profit and nonprofit hospitals in the United States since 1980. The author systematically and comprehensively surveyed peer-reviewed publications to clarify this question. The author's second objective was to learn what proportion of all research assessing for-profit and nonprofit health care providers is devoted to hospitals compared to all other providers. The third goal was to discover how any trends in observed performance differences among hospitals compare with trends among other provider types. Computerized bibliographic searches of all relevant databases yielded seventy-five studies (ninety-three assessments) that compared the performance of for-profit and nonprofit hospitals on four performance criteria: access, quality, cost or efficiency, and amount of charity care. The author coded findings on performance in one of three ways: for-profit superiority, nonprofit superiority, or inconclusive. Most studies (60 percent) reported that nonprofit hospitals have better relative performance than for-profit hospitals, clear evidence of their organizational effectiveness. Thirty-one percent were inconclusive, and 8 percent reported that for-profits were better."
1272	2003	NML	14:01	Mission attachment and satisfaction as factors in employee retention	"Nonprofit organizations rely on the mission to attract resources and guide decision making. Increasingly, mission statements are recognized as a strong management tool that can motivate employees and keep them focused on the organization's purpose. This research investigated employee attitudes toward the mission in a youth and recreation service organization. In general, the employees expressed positive attitudes toward the organization's mission, and those attitudes were related to employee satisfaction and intentions to remain with the organization. However, dissatisfaction with pay tended to override employee's mission attachment as explanation of why they may leave the organization. The implication is that mission might be salient in attracting employees but less effective in retaining them."
1273	2003	NML	14:01	Welfare reform and the future of nonprofit organizations	"This article discusses implications of the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) for nonprofit social service organizations. We emphasize their role in the contemporary social safety net in relation to the public sector. Based on a study of ninety organizations operating in the Detroit metropolitan area, we adopted the supplementary, complementary, and adversarial framework from Young (1999) to assess the complex and evolving relationship between the nonprofit and public sectors in the post-PRWORA era. The findings indicate a clear presence of all three perspectives, however, the continued shifting of responsibility for social services to private, nonprofit organizations suggests a growing dominance of the supplementary role. This raises concerns regarding future nonprofit capacity and other potential costs of nonprofit sector service provision."
1274	2003	NML	14:01	"Community as a factor in implementing interorganizational partnerships: Issues, constraints, and adaptations"	"This article reports findings from a community-based study of collaboration among seven nonprofit human service agencies in a very low-income urban neighborhood. The project, funded by a federal demonstration grant, was developed to prevent child abuse and neglect as an alternative to the existing public child welfare system. Findings suggest that privatization, funding uncertainties, and community-level factors posed external stressors that constrained executives ability to collaborate. The article identifies five key stressors, analyzes how each constrained the partnership, and then discusses specific adaptations made by executive leadership in political, technical, and interpersonal areas that facilitated strategic adjustment and realignment in a very complex interorganizational arrangement and set of relationships. Finally, implications are drawn for nonprofit managers, social policy, and nonprofit research."
1275	2003	NML	14:01	Continuity planning for nonprofits	"Many nonprofits assist in emergency response and disaster relief to alleviate human suffering. In order to enhance those efforts and the maintenance of routine nonprofit operations, this article introduces the concept of continuity planning. Continuity planning does not focus on specific risks, such as floods or hurricanes, but on the maintenance of critical operational processes despite natural, anthropogenic, or technological interruptions. Continuity planning has yet to be widely applied within the nonprofit sector, primarily due to a lack of fiscal or personnel resources. This article explores several continuity-planning options for nonprofits and provides a brief explanation of the process."
1276	2003	NML	14:01	The DIRECTIONS nonprofit resource assessment model: A tool for small nonprofit organizations	"Rapid growth in the number of nonprofits has created a shortage of trained staff and experienced volunteer leadership for nonprofit organizations. The Nonprofit Education Initiative (NEI) in South Carolina developed the DIRECTIONS nonprofit resource assessment model to provide tools to help nonprofits better meet the challenges facing our communities tools that will help nonprofits develop effective plans, integrate resources, diversify revenue, communicate effective messages, and motivate constituents. These tools are also inexpensive and available close to home. he research and development process was a cooperative effort between the Department of Parks, Recreation, and Tourism Management and Clemson University Cooperative Extension Service, with funding from the W. K. Kellogg Foundation. Cooperative Extension is a component of the land grant university system, the largest educational delivery system in the world. Cooperative Extension's role is to plan, execute, deliver, and evaluate learning programs consistent with locally identified needs. It helps people acquire the understanding, capabilities, attitudes, and skills essential to solving farm, home, and community problems. This article gives a background of the challenges facing nonprofit organizations in South Carolina, the steps taken to develop this new assessment model, and results of research conducted throughout the development process."
1277	2003	NML	14:02	Managers as knowledge generators: The nature of practitioner-scholar research in the nonprofit sector	"As nonprofit management education develops, it has the opportunity to consider new premises concerning managers roles. In the design and practice of traditional management education, managers are assumed to be the ultimate users of knowledge. Less attention is given to educating managers to be knowledge generators who combine intimate understanding of issues, problems, and settings with established theory and methods. Based on a discussion of three research projects undertaken in nonprofit settings by participants in a doctoral program for advanced practitioners at the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve University, we describe seven dimensions of practitioner-scholar inquiry. The pattern of practitioner-scholar research that emerges from these research projects is contrasted with two other modes of knowledge production. Implications for practitioner-scholar inquiry and for the education of practitioner-scholars in the nonprofit sector are discussed."
1278	2003	NML	14:02	Liability and volunteer organizations: A survey of the law	"The question of how and when liability attaches is one of the most important issues facing volunteer organizations today. The liability issue has three related components: (1) whether the organization is liable to third parties for acts performed by volunteers, (2) whether the organization is liable to volunteers who are injured while performing their duties, and (3) whether an individual volunteer is liable for acts performed while working with a volunteer organization. This article explores each of these issues and suggests effective risk management practices that can reduce, although not eliminate, liability in most instances."
1279	2003	NML	14:02	Leadership in education: Effective U.K. college principals	"College leaders face increasing challenges to manage complex responsibilities. They must possess a wide variety of managerial and leadership skills to be successful in academic environments, which are beginning to resemble more traditional organizational frameworks. The study examined in this article explored the relationships among managerial style, organizational climate, and several measures of college-student performance with a sample of British further education college principals (similar to U.S. community college presidents). While considering the influence of various background factors, such as the size of the college, student funding, and years of experience, several significant relationships emerged demonstrating a significant association between principals managerial behaviors and measures of college and student performance."
1280	2003	NML	14:02	Making sense of accountability: Conceptual perspectives for northern and southern nonprofits	"This article examines the concept of accountability from various disciplinary lenses in order to develop an integrated understanding of the term. Special attention is devoted to principal agent perspectives from political science and economics. An integrated framework is developed, based on four central observations. (1) Accountability is relational in nature and is constructed through inter- and intraorganizational relationships. (2) Accountability is complicated by the dual role of nonprofits as both principals and agents in their relationships with other actors. (3) Characteristics of accountability necessarily vary with the type of nonprofit organization being examined. (4) Accountability operates through external as well as internal processes, such that an emphasis on external oversight and control misses other dimensions of accountability essential to nonprofit organizations. The analysis draws from the experiences of both Northern and Southern nonprofits, that is, organizations based in wealthy industrialized regions of the world (the global North) and those in economically poorer areas (the South)."
1281	2003	NML	14:02	The understanding of internal control principles by pastors	"Although the concept of internal control is as relevant to churches as it is to profit-seeking organizations, many authors have indicated that churches typically have weak systems of internal control. Pastors usually serve in the position of chief professional officer of their churches, and the implementation and maintenance of an adequate system of internal control is ultimately the responsibility of management. This study is a preliminary effort to determine whether pastors understand general principles of internal control and are able to recognize strengths and weaknesses in systems of internal control. The results show that pastors have a reasonable ability to recognize strengths and weaknesses in internal control systems in churches."
1282	2004	NML	14:03	How faith-based social service organizations manage secular pressures associated with government funding	"This article reports selected findings from a qualitative case study of two faith-based social service organizations to address two questions: (1) How does government funding influence the religious characteristics of faith-based social service organizations? (2) How do government-funded, faith-based social service organizations manage the tensions arising from both secular and religious contexts? The findings suggest that the adaptation of secular institutional practices is not as inevitable as some have feared. Rather, the two organizations studied showed convincingly that their faith traditions and values were alive and widely evident throughout their organizations. Three key strategies emerged as means for maintaining religiousness in the face of secular pressures: (1) Religious identities were perceived as given rather than chosen, and therefore were not negotiable, (2) religious values provided strong justification for seeking relationships with others who do not share their faith, (3) the religious worldview blurred religious and secular distinctions so that secular technologies and practices could comfortably be utilized."
1283	2004	NML	14:03	The role of religious networks and other factors in types of volunteer work	"In view of current efforts to strengthen volunteering and promote the faith-based provision of social services in the United States, we examine both the underlying complexity of volunteering and who performs particular types of volunteer work. This paper, drawing on a telephone interview survey of 526 randomly selected Indiana residents, considers whether religious involvement helps explain engagement in different types of volunteer work independent of such other contributing factors as family status, socioeconomic status, and community attachment. We find that religious involvement plays an independent role, but only for certain types of volunteer work."
1284	2004	NML	14:03	Work-life policies and programs: Comparing the responsiveness of nonprofit and for-profit organizations	"Analysis of the data from the 1998 Business Work-Life Study, one of the first comprehensive studies of how U.S. organizations are responding to the work-life needs of the nation's changing workforce, indicates that nonprofits with one hundred or more employees are more likely than for-profits to offer particular types of work-life policies and programs (such as extended leaves following birth or adoption) and to pay for at least some of the costs of health insurance for part-time employees. In contrast, nonprofits are less likely to offer other work-life supports (such as paid maternity leave). Despite the resource constraints that can restrict the compensation and benefits packages offered by some nonprofits, the overall scope of the work-life initiatives established by nonprofits is similar to those initiatives at for-profit organizations. Regression analyses find that although organizations profit status does not explain variance in the scope of their work-life initiatives, three of the variables measured by this study (indicators of workplace commitment to diversity and work-life issues, percentage of women in executive positions, and the size of the workforce) do."
1285	2004	NML	14:03	Exploring OD in Africa: A response to David Lewis	"Organization development (OD) has become an increasingly popular approach among international donors who are eager to improve the impact of their aid to developing countries. Major questions, however, have been raised as to whether this is not another example of technique peddling by Western donors and consultants. Many argue that this participatory, imported, Western approach to organizational change relies on cultural assumptions of open discussion that are simply not present in many developing societies. Taking up Lewis challenge in his article Organization and Management in the Third Sector: Towards a Cross-Cultural Research Agenda (NML 2002), this article explores the veracity of such concerns. Using practitioner experience of implementing OD with African NGOs, this article reveals that many principles of OD are pre-existing within African cultures and are not a new foreign import. It concludes that, as with any culture, there are aspects that undermine and reinforce particular approaches to management and change. An anthropological perspective can assist in understanding the local culture sufficiently to be able to identify, avoid, or overcome cultural resistance, while at the same time using cultural symbols as levers for change"
1286	2004	NML	14:03	"Mission, money, and merit: Strategic decision making by nonprofit managers"	"Public and nonprofit organizations need to make strategic choices about where to invest their resources. They also need to expose hidden managerial assumptions and lack of adequate knowledge that prevent the attainment of consensus in strategic decision making. The approach we developed and tested in the field used a dynamic, three-dimensional model that tracks individual programs in an organization's portfolio on their contribution to mission, money, and merit. The first dimension measures whether the organization is doing the right things, the second, whether it is doing things right financially, and the third, whether it doing things right in terms of quality. Senior managers provide their own evaluations of the organization's programs. Both the consensus view and the variation in individual assessments contribute to an improved managerial understanding of the organization's current situation and to richer discussions in strategic decision making. In field tests, this visual model proved to be a useful and powerful tool for illuminating underlying assumptions and variations in knowledge among managers facing the complex, multidimensional tradeoffs needed in strategic decision making."
1287	2004	NML	14:04	Is all well in the neighborhood? Conflict on neighborhood boards in Milwaukee	"Neighborhood organizations have become more important players in urban areas in recent years due to a renewed interest in social capital and an emphasis on the continuing development of community. With this elevated status comes more responsibility for the delivery of services to citizens and scrutiny by these very citizens, the press, and government officials. Much of what we know about neighborhood organizations comes from our observations of board deliberations. Through these deliberations board members make decisions that affect neighborhood constituents. In this study we examine the context in which neighborhood boards in the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, make decisions. Using theory borrowed from the literature on local government boards, we develop a series of testable hypotheses relating to the level of conflict on these boards. Our findings indicate that conflict is relatively low across boards in Milwaukee, however, the number of board member and certain behavioral variables explain a significant amount of the variance in the level of conflict."
1288	2004	NML	14:04	Neighborhood associations and urban decision making in Albuquerque	"Neighborhood associations have the potential to be important players in the urban decision-making process. There are numerous examples of situations in which they have exercised their unique capabilities to influence decisions that have a direct impact on their members. But their role in the larger arena of the city they inhabit is less clear. This study explores the degree to which neighborhood associations, through their newsletters, acknowledge and support citywide goals. A content analysis of 173 newsletters from forty-four neighborhood associations in Albuquerque, New Mexico, revealed that they do provide some support for several citywide goals but not for the majority of them"
1289	2004	NML	14:04	The legitimacy of social enterprise	"Social enterprise has emerged as a businesslike contrast to the traditional nonprofit organization. This article develops an explanatory direction for social enterprise based on institutional perspectives rather than more traditional rational economic concepts. Through Suchman's typology of legitimacy (1995), the article argues that the origin and evolution of social enterprise is put into dramatically different focus, particularly through the concept of moral legitimacy. Moral legitimacy not only connects the overall emergence of social enterprise with neoconservative, pro-business, and promarket political and ideological values that have become central in many nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development but also explains the observation that social enterprise is being more frequently understood and practiced in more narrow commercial and revenue-generation terms."
1290	2004	NML	14:04	Artistic quality in an opera company: Toward the development of a concept	"This article elaborates a first concept for defining artistic quality in a nonprofit professional opera company. To specify the artistic quality of an opera company, we identify two components: profile quality and performance quality. The article discusses the limitations of this preliminary concept and considerations for further research on artistic quality in an opera company."
1291	2004	NML	14:04	Management-capacity building in the Pittsburgh region	"This article describes the strategy for management-capacity building employed by The Forbes Funds in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Like many other cities, Pittsburgh's capacity-building industry has grown dramatically in recent years and is somewhat fragmented. But The Forbes Funds, along with other philanthropic organizations, have played an important role in developing a coherent system of management support services for nonprofit organizations in the Pittsburgh area. The article concludes with lessons that can be applied in other regions of the country."
1292	2004	NML	15:01	Responsibilities and roles of boards in nonprofit organizations: The Israeli case	"In this study, nine roles and responsibilities of boards of directors in nonprofit organizations in Israel are examined and perceptions of these roles and responsibilities by chairpersons of the boards and the executive directors are compared. Four groupings of board roles were found: senior human resource management, maintenance of relationships with the task environment, policymaking, and fiscal management and fundraising. The findings show that in most organizations boards fulfill all these roles and play a significant role in decision making. A significant consensus exists between chairpersons and executive directors in respect to most of the boards roles, whereas significant differences in perceptions were found in respect to financial matters and maintenance of relationships with the task environment."
1293	2004	NML	15:01	The devil is in the details: Implementing secular outcome measurement methods in faith-based organizations	"Faith-based organizations (FBOs) are now being encouraged to seek federal funding for the purpose of supporting faith-based delivery of social services in local communities (that is, the Compassionate Capital Fund). This shift in the federal perspective has resulted in increased attention to the effectiveness of the services provided by FBOs. Though rigorous demonstrations are needed to determine the relative effectiveness of FBO services, other available alternatives offer a viable avenue to aid FBOs in improving their programs and monitoring their success. One such alternative is the use of outcome measurement techniques, such as those that have been infusing the nonprofit sector in the United States since the mid-1990s, particularly among United Way funded programs. This chapter discusses how to adapt secular outcomes measurement approaches to faith-based organizations and their programs and the likely pitfalls that FBOs will face."
1294	2004	NML	15:01	Managing cross-border cooperation between voluntary organizations in Ireland	"The voluntary nonprofit sector in Ireland has grown significantly in recent years. A related trend has been the growth of cross-border (in effect, transnational) cooperation between voluntary organizations based in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. However, this development has posed a set of management issues in terms of structure, forms of governance and decision making, day-to-day project management, and sustainability. Cross-border work has also meant that voluntary bodies confront a distinctive set of barriers in relation to political and ethnic conflict, social and cultural attitudes, and practical delivery. Strengthening of cooperation across borders will require greater planning, mainstream funding, focused management, diversification of services, and realistic expectations."
1295	2004	NML	15:01	Leader-member exchanges and board performance of voluntary sport organizations	"Using leader-member exchange theory developed by Dansereau, Graen, and Haga (1975), this chapter analyzes the dyadic relationship between leaders (board chairs and paid executives) and members (volunteer board members) within the boards of Australian voluntary sport organizations. The chapter specifically examines the quality of leader-member exchanges that exist within a sample of thirty-four Queensland State Sporting Organizations and their relationship with board performance. It was found that board chairs and executives perceived the quality of their leader-member exchanges to be higher than their respective relationships with board members, and that higher-quality leader-member exchanges among all three possible pairings of executives, board chairs, and board members were positively related to higher levels of board performance. The chapter discusses implications and directions for further research into leader-member exchanges within voluntary sports organizations."
1296	2004	NML	15:01	"Building a profile of Missouri CSBG community action agencies: Capacities, coping strategies, and the new public management"	"Given the current environment of devolution, welfare reform, and fiscal retrenchment, this study examines the role of local nonprofit entities, called Community Action Agencies, operating under the auspices of the Community Services Block Grant program. Survey results indicate that despite an increase in working poor requiring CSBG services, staffs have been able to cope with increased demands. Community Action Agencies have been able to keep pace with increasing client demands by means of a variety of measures, including fund leveraging, resource competition, and relationship building. Accountability concerns and business-oriented practices also were found to be a high priority of these agencies."
1297	2004	NML	15:01	Small organization mergers in arts and humanities	"This chapter discusses a case study of the merger between two relatively small organizations: a local nonprofit arts council and a public county-level humanities commission. As this case deviates from other merger analyses that tend to focus on larger health and social service agencies, the chapter examines how well key findings of the nonprofit merger literature apply to mergers of organizations of smaller size and in other fields. Generally, we find that the merger literature so far provides sufficient guidance for nonprofit managers in fields such as the arts, where merger pressures have only now begun to mount."
1298	2004	NML	15:01	"Joining forces, fortunes, and futures: Restructuring and adaptation in nonprofit hospice organizations"	"Nonprofit organizations operate in tumultuous times characterized by constrained funding, increased competition, and greater demand for social services. Existing bases of intangible and tangible assets often are insufficient to fulfill service missions. These organizations appear to be responding by joining forces and restructuring to better accommodate diminished resources. Relatively little is known about the reorganization strategies being employed. The study described in this chapter examined the phenomenon of organizational restructuring among nonprofit hospice organizations. In particular, it identified the factors that propel nonprofits to pursue restructuring as a strategic solution, the elements that impede such restructuring efforts, and how organizations that pursue and implement restructuring differ from those that do not. The study found that an organization's relative placement along a continuum of political and economic strength is determinative in the outcome of its restructuring efforts. Those that take affirmative steps operate from a position of economic strength and exhibit independence in governance and decision making, those that do not are impeded by internal political factors."
1299	2004	NML	15:02	"Transformational leadership, organizational culture, and innovativeness in nonprofit organizations"	"This is an exploratory study of leadership, organizational culture, and organizational innovativeness in a sample of nonprofit human service organizations: Associations of Retarded Citizens. Although leadership has been held out as one of the most important predictors of innovation, this study found it was not correlated with organizational innovativeness. Examination of the relationships between leadership and cultural variables provided some alternative explanations for this finding. Positive relationships among transformational leadership, organizational values, and cultural consensus (degree of agreement among employees on those values) indicate that leadership practices employed in this sample created strong cultural consensus around values that may inhibit innovation. These findings suggest that examining the link between leadership and organizational culture is important for understanding how leadership and innovation are related. This article sets out practical implications, based on the results of the study, that may help nonprofit managers create workplaces supportive of innovation."
1300	2004	NML	15:02	Public reporting: A neglected aspect of nonprofit accountability	"Nonprofit organizations have a compulsory external accountability (largely involving financial reporting) to government agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service and state regulators. They also have a pragmatic must-do accountability to their funders, clients, and other obvious stakeholders. But are nonprofits also accountable to the public at large? If so, how can such accountability be implemented, given the diffuseness and breadth of the public as an audience? This article suggests that nonprofits should consider the citizenry as a stakeholder, if only due to the substantial taxpayer subsidy of the sector. The theory of public reporting that emerged in public administration literature beginning in the 1920s and 1930s can be helpful. Using principles, templates, and examples from public administration, nonprofit organizations can pursue more vigorous public reporting as one method to increase citizen confidence in their activities and in the sector as a whole."
1301	2004	NML	15:02	Balancing strategy and accountability: A model for the governance of professional associations	"Professional associations are operating in a context of uncertainty and change, with which their traditional governance structures struggle to manage. After describing this context and presenting a brief overview of relevant governance literature, a project aimed at supporting the redesign of governance structures and procedures among five professional associations in the United Kingdom is outlined. Three specific governance issues are examined: size of councils (council is the term used for a governing body of a U.K. professional association), their composition in relation to electoral processes, and the development of inner councils, or executive boards, within councils. Finally, we present a normative model, the cupped hands model, that has arisen from the research. This model offers a possible means of balancing the representation required by their status as membership associations with the requirement that professional associations become more strategic and proactive."
1302	2004	NML	15:02	Volunteer and coordinator perspectives on managing women volunteers	"Recent changes in Australia, such as the new public management and national competition policy, have affected the way that human services are provided and have complicated the role of volunteer coordinators. However, because volunteers are free to choose their level of contribution, it is the volunteers perspective that is the ultimate yardstick against which their coordination is assessed. The aim of the research examined here was a deeper understanding of women volunteers and their coordinators views of their work. The research was conducted within a qualitative paradigm, employing individual and focus group interviews. The analysis identified eight areas of concern for volunteers around their management. The analysis of the coordinators interviews revealed three coordination styles horizontal, nurturing, and managerial of which the managerial was most in conflict with the volunteers perspective."
1303	2004	NML	15:02	Commitment and performance of nonprofit board members	"Boards of nonprofit organizations are entrusted to oversee and ensure that the organization remains true to its mission, functions within the confines of state and federal laws, and operates in a financially responsible manner. This critically important oversight is carried out by volunteers. This study examined the relationships between board member commitment and individual performance. Commitment was assessed using Meyer and Allen's Three-Component Model of Commitment: Affective, Continuance, and Normative (1991). The population in this study was volunteer board members of midsized, social service nonprofit organizations in the Orange County, California, area. The strongest findings were between affective commitment and performance in board roles. Committed board members reported more involvement and are perceived by the executive to be more engaged and valuable. Analysis revealed that executive judgments of participation are based on both board member behavior and Affective commitment expressed by the board member."
1304	2005	NML	15:03	The governance self-assessment checklist: An instrument for assessing board effectiveness	"This article describes the development and validation of the Governance Self-Assessment Checklist (GSAC). The GSAC was designed to assist boards of directors of nonprofit and public sector organizations to identify strengths and weaknesses in the governance of their organizations, educate board members about the essentials of good governance, and improve their governance practices. The instrument comprises 144 items organized into twelve subscales. The results of the study indicated that the subscales have excellent internal consistency reliability, exhibit good criterion-related validity, and are able to discriminate between stronger and weaker aspects of board functioning. The relative strengths and weaknesses in board effectiveness were identified, and the implications of the findings for the assessment of board effectiveness and field applications of the GSAC were discussed."
1305	2005	NML	15:03	Managing stakeholder relationships and nonprofit organization effectiveness	"This research examined how nonprofit organizations manage their relationships with stakeholders and how these practices relate to perceived organization effectiveness. We conducted semistructured, open-ended interviews with executive directors of nonprofit organizations (NPOs) to discover whom they see as their stakeholders, the types of expectations they encounter from stakeholders, and the practices they use in managing stakeholder relationships. The two nonprofits that were evaluated as most effective used a consistent, thematic rationale in dealing with stakeholder issues: one organization discussed its actions in terms of its mission and core values, the other based its actions in terms of building relationships and networks. Our study suggests that organizations that ground their external relations in issues that are recognized as good nonprofit management, and do so consistently across stakeholder groups, will tend to be rated as more effective by multiple, external evaluators."
1306	2005	NML	15:03	Exploring the association between board and organizational performance in nonprofit organizations	"Note: This study investigated six dimensions of effective board performance, as suggested by Chait, Holland, and Taylor (1991), in relation to three theoretical explanations (agency theory, resource dependency theory, and group/decision process theory) of how board governance activities potentially influence organizational performance. Survey research findings revealed that strategic contributions from the board are more robust in organizations with higher financial performance. In addition, organizations that are judged to be higher performing also reported having high-performing boards across all dimensions. In particular, the interpersonal dimension provided a unique explanation of judgments of organizational performance."
1307	2005	NML	15:03	Playing by the rules: Restricted endowment assets in colleges and universities	"Endowments serve as financial buffers and safety nets for post-secondary institutions in uncertain financial times. Donor-restricted gifts and bequests often complicate the management and deployment of endowment assets. Public policy concerns, the Uniform Management of Institutional Funds Acts, and related case law are changing approaches used by states to alter the donors dead hand when time and circumstances make carrying out conditions of restricted bequests unworkable."
1308	2005	NML	15:03	An Italian pattern of social enterprise: The social cooperative	"The article describes how the social cooperative has become instrumental in the expansion of the social economy in Italy. It reports the contribution these associations have made to broadening the concept and parameters of volunteer organizations, providing basic social welfare services and integrating many disadvantaged people into the active society. By virtue of their ability to activate wider social projects, this type of social enterprise could be of interest and relevance to other countries (following this example, in 2001 the French government created the Societes cooperatives d'int_r_t collectif), but they call for adequate competencies and protection under specific laws because, on the whole, they are too small and depended on public contributions."
1309	2005	NML	15:04	Accounting for the value of volunteer contributions	"There is a need for an accounting paradigm that properly illustrates the value that nonprofits generate. Much of that value comes from volunteer contributions, which are significant but for the most part are not included in financial accounting statements, even though our research indicates that they account for almost a third of the value added by these organizations. This article reports the results of two studies related to measuring volunteer value in the accounting of nonprofits and then draws some policy implications from the research. The first study, a survey of 156 nonprofits in Canada, found that although about one-third of the sample kept records of volunteer hours, only 3 percent included a value for them in their accounting statements. The second study, of nonprofit accountants, found that they did not feel that financial accounting statements properly represented the contribution of their organizations. A series of policy recommendations are presented, including suggestions for revising the regulations of accounting bodies for imputing volunteer value and creating accounting statements that better represent the contribution of nonprofits."
1310	2005	NML	15:04	Structures and processes in intermediary nongovernmental organizations: Research evidence from Northern Ireland	"This article reports the results of an exploratory study of the organizational characteristics, functions, and roles of intermediary nonprofit organizations selected by the European Union to deliver global grant funding in relation to its Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland. The results show that the main factor for determining organizational processes is the need to respond to conflicting pressures from two directions: upward to funding agencies and downward to community groups. This produces contradictory demands that are imported into the organizations as a set of internal tensions. The different structures and capabilities developed by the organizations to maintain unity and integrity in response to these tensions are explored and related to differences in the perceived role of the organizations."
1311	2005	NML	15:04	Charitable bingo in Indiana: Issues and implications	"Despite portrayals of gambling as a social vice, charitable gaming is big business in the United States and globally. While many nonprofit organizations sponsor charitable gaming events, such as bingo nights for their members and communities, to raise both friends and funds for their organizations, charitable gaming operations receive little attention from researchers. This article focuses on charitable bingo and contrasts bingo's often folkloric background with the contemporary realities of charitable gaming. Our exploratory analysis offers reasons that bingo deserves study and calls researchers and practitioners attention to the scope and some of the implications of bingo operations. We focus on the characteristics of nonprofit organizations reporting bingo revenue in Indiana. Our findings suggest that while some nonprofits may be using bingo to raise much-needed funds or provide a social and recreational outlet for organization or community members, bingo is an uncertain financial pursuit for most organizations. We use a descriptive case study of bingo in Indiana to explore and illustrate the issues and questions raised in the article and to set up an agenda for future research on charitable bingo."
1312	2005	NML	15:04	A social identity model of prosocial behaviors within nonprofit organizations	"This study draws on social identity theory, while developing and testing the Social Identification Model of Prosocial Behavior among voluntary participants in nonprofit organizations. This model posits relationships between organization identification, commitment, satisfaction, and prosocial behavior among nonprofit volunteers. Path analysis results indicate successful identification of the model. Specifically, when volunteers identified with their nonprofit, they had higher levels of prosocial behaviors, commitment, and satisfaction. This study provides several important extensions to social identity theory and nonprofit literatures while highlighting the need for further research examining motivations behind prosocial behaviors within nonprofits."
1313	2005	NML	16:01	Developmental contexts of nonprofit management education	"The 1980s and 1990s saw the beginning and rapid growth of nonprofit management education. Literature on this topic has focused principally on directly practical concerns such as rationale, curriculum, faculty, students, funding, alumni, and employer satisfaction and the best place for such programs within universities. Broadening that discussion, this article clarifies why nonprofit management education took the form it did and happened when it did by setting it within three contexts: professional education, management education, and the post World War II growth of the nonprofit sector."
1314	2005	NML	16:01	Managers of nonprofit organizations are rewarded for performance	"We consider the effect of performance on the compensation of nonprofit executives. Performance is measured as the ratio of revenue from a particular activity (such as fundraising or program services) to the expenditures associated with those services, exclusive of managerial compensation. This is consistent with previous works, which use measures of size, spending, or budget percentages as measures of performance. We also consider whether the compensation received by the executives enhances their performance. The empirical results support the hypothesis that compensation and performance are simultaneously determined."
1315	2005	NML	16:01	Diversifying revenue sources in Canada: Are women's voluntary organizations different?	"Government policies in Canada have taken a hard right turn, and tax cuts now have priority over investing in social programming. Both federal and provincial governments have been withdrawing from direct service provision, with the expectation that the voluntary sector will fill the gap. At the same time, traditional government support for the voluntary sector has declined, which limits the ability of organizations to meet their current service demands. Using a sample of 645 organizations from across Canada, this article explores the use of revenue diversification as a response to policy changes. The findings indicate that the factors related to voluntary organizations in Canada embracing revenue diversification to support program delivery differ for organizations run by women and nongendered organizations."
1316	2005	NML	16:01	The antecedents of donor commitment to voluntary organizations	"The past decade has seen a rapid growth in the number of regular or so-called committed giving schemes. Charities have been increasingly eager to solicit donors onto a low-value monthly donation, collected automatically from their bank account or credit card. Although the initial costs of donor acquisition are higher than for cash donations, charities find that committed givers are less likely to lapse and therefore offer substantially higher lifetime values over time. In this article, we examine to what extent these individuals are truly committed, that is, whether they are more committed than occasional cash givers and the factors that might drive that commitment. The results of a series of ten focus groups conducted on behalf of five large national charities are reported and a model of the antecedents of commitment hypothesized. Implications for fundraising strategy are explored."
1317	2005	NML	16:01	I want to move once I have got things straight: Voluntary sector chief executives career accounts	"This article reports investigation into chief executives career perceptions, experiences, and aspirations in small and medium-sized organizations in England, using career history and biographical narrative techniques. Career accounts from sixty chief executives twenty-seven women and thirty-three men were gathered and analyzed, drawing on career theory and typologies of career characterization. A typology for voluntary sector chief executives career stances was developed: the Paid Philanthropists, the Careerists, and the Nonaligned. Within this typology, women chief executives appeared as predominantly Careerists, outnumbering male chief executives by two to one. Implications for developing career theory in voluntary sector contexts is discussed and directions for future research suggested."
1318	2005	NML	16:02	Improving performance? The adoption and implementation of quality systems in U.K. nonprofits	"There are increasing and multiple pressures on nonprofit organizations to demonstrate excellence in performance. Although there is a growing literature on the various approaches to performance improvement taken by nonprofits, little is known about the processes involved in the adoption and implementation of specific approaches. This article is about the adoption and use of one approach to performance improvement, quality systems, in the U.K. nonprofit sector. We report findings about factors that encourage nonprofits to adopt quality systems. We also analyze the distinctive challenges of implementing quality approaches in a nonprofit sector context and suggest critical success factors. The article concludes with a discussion of the organizational and policy implications of applying the management concepts of quality and performance to the nonprofit sector."
1319	2005	NML	16:02	Stewardship of public assets under nonprofit conversion models: New York's Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield case study	"This research describes a case study of the Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield conversion under way in New York. In January 2002, legislation approved the conversion and the disposition of $1 billion in assets: 95 percent for health care salaries and expenses and 5 percent for a foundation to promote health care for the poor. New York's approach is controversial. According to Greene and Sommerfield (2002), the New York Times considers it the largest fiscal gimmick in New York's history, and Consumers Union is challenging it in the courts, asserting the plan is illegal. This article describes New York's approach to nonprofit conversion, proposing that more research on conversions is needed and that case study research illustrating the way different states approach the issue has the potential to bring together researchers, practitioners, and policymakers in an important debate that will advance public policymaking that furthers the public good. Subsequently, on June 20, 2005, New York State's highest court dismissed the Consumers Union lawsuit, affirming the actions of the New York State legislature and bringing to an end nearly three years of state-level litigation."
1320	2005	NML	16:02	"Funding source, board involvement techniques, and financial vulnerability in nonprofit organizations: A test of resource dependence"	"The study examined here tested a resource dependence view of the organization on a sample of nonprofit social service agencies. Results indicated that CEOs of privately funded nonprofit agencies were more likely to use board involvement techniques than CEOs of government-funded or commercially supported organizations. In addition, privately funded agencies were less vulnerable to economic shock than government or commercially funded agencies, and funding source explained incremental variance in board involvement and vulnerability beyond characteristics of the organization and board. These results provide support for assertions of resource dependence theory and suggest that a CEO's strategic engagement with an organization's board depends in part on the nature and concentration of the organization's resources."
1321	2005	NML	16:02	How are employees of the nonprofit sector motivated? A research need	"This article reviews research on motivation of employees in the nonprofit sector, with a major emphasis on the motivation of teachers and hospital nursing staff. Although both areas are widely researched in the nonprofit sector, empirical motivation research conducted in schools and hospitals is certainly not extensive. Nevertheless, based on these limited research findings, we derive potential hypotheses for future research in schools and hospitals."
1322	2005	NML	16:02	Organizational culture and creative processes: Comparing German theater companies and scientific institutes	"An open organizational culture (for example, enhancement of individual autonomy) is needed in order to promote organizational creativity. But such openness can lead to problems with coordination that may jeopardize the organization's success. For example, an open organizational culture is accompanied by parallel processes of closure (promoting orientation, consensus, and trust) that reduce the negative secondary effects of openness (Gebert and others, 2004). It is thereby understood that the creative process in a theater company requires a greater effort at coordination than in scientific institutes. This is why cultural openness in a theater company comes with risk. Empirical results from interviews with 28 research institutes (N = 113) and 13 theater companies (N = 88) show that an open culture in theaters as well as in scientific institutes, is significantly connected to closed culture processes that serve as buffers. Furthermore, openness in a theater company in terms of risk prevention is developed significantly less than in scientific institutes. Also openness when the buffering closure is missing is not significantly connected to success in scientific institutes, and in theater companies there is even a significant negative connection. The need for buffering is thus especially meaningful for the results in a theater company."
1323	2006	NML	16:03	Moving ahead or falling behind? Volunteer promotion and data collection	"Substantial efforts have been expended to promote civic engagement during the 1990s and early 2000s. Yet as significant as volunteerism is economically, socially, and philosophically to the United States, surprisingly little in the way of longitudinal research has been carried out to assess the impact of these promotional activities. Few areas of civic engagement offer reliable trend data. We examine the available data in three areas: individual volunteering, volunteering to stipended government programs, and employee volunteering. We find modest but steady increases in volunteer numbers in all three areas, but point out numerous methodological problems that limit the reliability of present longitudinal data. We conclude by calling for a renewed financial investment in national volunteering surveys with a broader focus than current efforts."

Using archival data, it specifically investigates various indicators of ICT adoption and adoption readiness factors. Results illustrate that nonprofit organizations are beginning to position themselves to take advantage of the opportunities provided by ICT adoption."
1325	2006	NML	16:03	Leadership within Australian voluntary sport organization boards	"This article applies leader-member exchange theory to the study of dyadic relationships between leaders (board chairs and paid executives) and members (volunteer board members) within the boards of Australian voluntary sport organizations. The article specifically examines leader-member exchanges within a sample of six Queensland State sport organizations and their relationship with board performance. It was found that leadership within voluntary sport organization boards emanates from either board chairs or executives and that when the individuals fulfilling these roles are able to develop a mature working relationship, the board's ability to perform is enhanced. These findings extend our understanding of the importance of leadership roles held by volunteers and paid professionals for the achievement of organizational outcomes."

Knowing the value of the process while having an appreciation for the downside with regard to volume of work can help organizations make more educated decisions about how deeply they want to get involved with performance or outcome measurement. This article provides background information on performance measurement and examples of how it is being used in nonprofit organizations. Next, it presents methods of an exploratory study conducted in South Carolina. Finally, a discussion of results focuses on the effect of outcome measurement on management and funding as well as the need for more in-depth research."

Previous research on this topic has been limited and has focused on either structural problems or leadership. This explorative study examined psychosocial work environment factors (those related to the interplay of physical, mental, organizational, and social conditions in the workplace) in the Church of Sweden and used a top-down perspective. Data including documents and interviews and were analyzed and categorized in order to identify patterns of relevance for the psychosocial work environment in the organization. The results show four themes: unclear organization structure, a sense of being different, stressful work conditions, and a destructive communication style. The psychosocial work environment within the church is complex, characterized by deep conflicts that are often not dealt with."
1328	2006	NML	16:04	Quantitative research for nonprofit management	"Although the literature on organizational management has burgeoned recently, it has focused primarily on for-profit organizations. Moreover, widely published management prescriptions are often faddish in nature. It is risky for nonprofit managers to uncritically adopt these prescriptions. Not only may they be inappropriate for the Nonprofit setting, they may also be based on inadequate research. The nonprofit sector needs to develop its own research agenda and distribute usable findings to nonprofit managers. This process is in its infancy. While research on the nonprofit sector has been vigorous over the last few decades, most of it has focused on philanthropy or the delineation of the sector's dimensions. It is vitally important that management practices in the Nonprofit sector be based on sound, useful research. Given the nature of social science research, much of this will be quantitative research. In this article, I lay out some basic parameters of quantitative research and discuss its relevance to and utility for nonprofit management."
1329	2006	NML	16:04	Using multimethods ethnography to promote quality service and understand interactions among organizations	"Multimethods ethnography combines qualitative techniques with analysis of statistical data and sometimes mapping techniques. Ethnography provides a comprehensive picture of process in an agency or other setting by examining the dynamics between individuals and institutions to understand how systems work. Ethnography is particularly good at evaluating complex problems involving multiple stakeholders as well as understanding agency processes. I use examples from the Neighborhood Settlement House Evaluation Project and Kenosha Social Capital Study to describe the ethnographic method and its potential uses for nonprofit managers. I begin with an outline of methodological techniques, including problem definition, sample design, various data collection techniques, and analysis. Next I discuss ethnography's approach to the common research concerns of generalizability and replication. In concluding, I discuss ways that this method can be useful to nonprofit managers. Quality work is compared with less complete research techniques throughout each section."
1330	2006	NML	16:04	The economics of nonprofit organizations	"This article presents an economic view of Nonprofit institutions and insight into what the discipline can offer Nonprofit practitioners. I review the theories and assumptions behind economic models, then give an overview of the major areas of economic research in the Nonprofit sector. I then discuss various factors to consider when judging the quality of economic research. The discussion then turns to a brief overview of the major statistical tool used by economists: regression analysis. The point is not to teach practitioners to become expert econometricians but to provide a framework to judge the quality of economic research. The article concludes with suggestions for economic research that may be undertaken at the firm level."
1331	2006	NML	16:04	Historical research for the nonprofit sector	"Because there are many possible uses of history and conceptions of what constitutes historical inquiry, there can be no single description of historical research for the nonprofit sector. Nonprofit researchers, like all nonprofit leaders, cannot avoid having views of historical development, neither can they avoid the necessity of drawing conclusions from incomplete and indeterminate evidence, just as all historians must do. Students of the Nonprofit sector might want to pay particular attention to questions raised by legal and economic history (others have made much of the relevance of social and intellectual history). Most generally, historical materials and perspectives are especially relevant to the education of nonprofit leaders."
1332	2006	NML	16:04	The catalyst process: What academics provide to practitioners	"In this article, I explore what academics may offer community groups and practitioners by suggesting that scholars serve as catalysts that make community projects possible. One goal is to propose the catalyst model as a way of refocusing the action research paradigm. Action research is an established paradigm for scholars who wish to combine their research agenda with a desire to partner with community leaders on change projects. Discussions of action research tend to focus on the value of the approach for academics and methodological strategies that allow them to produce research their university colleagues consider legitimate. In the catalyst approach, we explore what university people provide in pragmatic terms that allows community movements and projects to move ahead. I deemphasize expert knowledge and focus instead on institutional resources. Scholars provide a gateway to a rich resource environment. The organization of professional work also allows scholars to give continuity to projects and to provide a framework that allows projects that otherwise might stall to move toward completion. The catalyst model eliminates the notion that scholars and practitioners belong to fundamentally different intellectual cultures and thereby removes one of the perceived barriers to effective action research. The model also indicates some organizational strategies for university people to use should they wish to set up long-term university-community partnerships.."

Such findings typically come from surveys of individuals or households, as opposed to surveys of nonprofits themselves. In this research article, we draw on a survey of a sample of Australian nonprofit organizations to demonstrate a method of empirically testing some of the ways that nonprofit organizations are said to reproduce social capital and to assess differences in any contributions by important organizational characteristics such as industry or primary beneficiary. We aim to show how surveys of organizations might add to our understanding of the contribution of nonprofits to stocks of social capital."
1334	2006	NML	17:01	Gambling on an alternative revenue source: The impact of riverboat gambling on the charitable gambling component of nonprofit finances	"This article examines the impact of casino gambling in and around Illinois on charitable gambling in that state. The research targets the impact of casino gambling on one of the vital revenue sources of many nonprofit organizations. Charitable gambling represents the most widespread form of legalized gambling in the United States. Net income from charitable gambling totaled an estimated $1.3 billion in 1997. Despite its apparent importance in providing an alternative revenue stream to nonprofit organizations, in a growing number of states charitable gambling operations must compete with an increasing number of private for-profit gambling enterprises, including riverboat and land-based casinos, Indian gambling operations, and pari-mutuel wagering venues. As a result, there is interest in the extent to which for-profit gambling is crowding out charitable gambling and in the process reducing funds (such as receipts from gambling operations) available to nonprofit organizations. The data analysis presented in this article suggests that spending on casino gambling in Illinois and in bordering areas of Indiana, Iowa, and Missouri may be displacing consumer expenditures on charitable gambling."
1335	2006	NML	17:01	Principal-agent relationships on the stewardship-agency axis	"This article provides an overview of the literature on nonprofit principal-agent relationships. It depicts the nature of agency theory and stewardship theory, analyzes the origin of their struggle within the nonprofit structure, and marks directions for a conciliatory approach. We open with an introduction to agency theory and discuss the two main components of its mathematical branch. We thereby contrast it with stewardship theory and elaborate on the arguments that can affect the position of nonprofit principal-agent relationships on the stewardship-agency axis. Analysis of the existing literature points to a lack of consensus as to which theory should be applied. We argue that the division of nonprofit principal-agent relationships into board-manager and manager-employee interactions may help to clarify the balance between agency theory and stewardship theory and may lead to the establishment of a strongly founded theory on nonprofit principal-agent relationships. We close with a discussion of how this article may prove valuable to nonprofit policymakers and other empirical researchers."
1336	2006	NML	17:01	Bequest motives and barriers to giving: The case of direct mail donors	"Charitable bequests currently account for 9 percent of overall giving in the United States. In this study we examine the motives for this form of support and the potential barriers to giving perceived by members of bequest societies or legacy clubs solicited through direct mail. Through a series of eight focus groups we delineate the individual motives for offering a bequest, the organizational factors that drive gifts of this type, and the potential barriers that could prevent such a gift from being made. The implications for professional fundraising practice are explored."
1337	2006	NML	17:01	Executive functional experience and its relationship to the financial performance of nonprofit organizations	"This study examines the relationship between a chief executive's functional business experience and multiple financial measures of Nonprofit organization performance within higher education foundations. Executive experience in specific business disciplines was found to be associated with two financial performance outcomes examined in this study. Specifically, prior functional experience of CEOs in the areas of accounting, production, and marketing were significant and positive predictors of financial performance."
1338	2006	NML	17:01	A scale to assess board member motivations in nonprofit organizations	"The purpose of this study was to develop a framework for identifying the motivations of board members in nonprofit organizations. Building on previous work of board member motivations (Searle, 1989, Inglis, 1994) and motivations of direct service volunteers (Clary and others, 1998), the results of the current study support a framework consisting of six components: Enhancement of Self-Worth, Learning Through Community, Helping the Community, Developing Individual Relationships, Unique Contributions to the Board, and Self-Healing. We discuss contributions by the panel of experts who reviewed the instrument and by the respondents who offered additional reasons for joining the board in view of how they can add validity to scale development. Frameworks such as the one reported in this article are valuable for understanding the complex involvement of attitudes and motivations as they relate to individuals decisions to join boards. These insights may be applied in areas such as board member recruitment, training and development, and retention."

AA has maintained an alternative form of collectivistic-democratic voluntary organization for more than seventy years. Its organizational form was developed within its first five years and articulated in its foundational text, Alcoholics Anonymous, published in 1939. Based on detailed histories of its early years, an analysis of AA's crucial ingredients suggests that six factors interacted to avoid the temptations of power, money, and professionalization that would have resulted in a bureaucratic form of organization or oligarchic leadership. In order to avoid death and to obtain or maintain abstinence, the desperate cofounders stumbled on the essential method: egalitarian peers share their lived experiences, conveying hope and strength to one another. In the context of the essential method, the two cofounders, from the Midwest and New York City, held similar spiritual beliefs and practiced a self-reflexive mode of social experiential learning gained from the Oxford Group, a nondenominational group that advocated healing through personal spiritual change, they downplayed their charismatic authority in favor of consulting with and abiding by the consensus of the group."
1340	2006	NML	17:02	The ironic value of loyalty: Dispute resolution strategies in worker cooperatives and conventional organizations	"Employee retention and satisfaction are key concerns for employers. In this article, I explore a variety of worker characteristics that affect how workers respond to troubling events and circumstances in the workplace. I examine how they approach their workplace problems, focusing on the value of their loyalty and how this loyalty might affect their problem-related decisions. This research suggests that worker loyalty presents an irony for managers, which I call the ironic value of loyalty: workers with greater loyalty are less likely to exit when they encounter workplace problems, decreasing turnover problems, yet when more loyal workers choose to remain at work, they are more likely to raise grievances, either formally or informally, to confront the problems. Thus, worker loyalty appears both to solve and create problems for managers dealing with worker discontent."
1341	2006	NML	17:02	Leadership styles and leadership change in human and community service organizations	"This article describes and analyzes leadership styles and leadership change in human and community service organizations. Based on the assumption that leadership styles must adapt to changing environments, four case studies of human and community service organizations are presented in an effort to determine the appropriate leadership style for each of the organizations described at different stages of the organizational life cycle. Emphasis is placed on the need to adapt leadership styles to the unique circumstances that prevail in the organization, based on a theoretical model that integrates different perspectives on leadership roles. The main argument is that in order to be effective, leaders must develop awareness of and sensitivity to changing situations and organizational constraints. Specifically, they should know when to adopt a task-oriented style versus a people-oriented style and when to adopt an internal versus an external orientation"
1342	2006	NML	17:02	How does accountability affect mission? The case of a nonprofit serving immigrants and refugees	"This article examines accountability processes in a nonprofit organization serving immigrants and refugees, with special attention to their impacts on mission-based activities. The research finds that upward accountability requirements of donors do not necessarily yield improved mission achievement, and practitioners thus have to navigate a complex environment of pressures. We identify a series of strategies that nonprofit executives and staff use to manage the tensions between upward accountability and mission: a prioritization of lateral accountability, staff empowerment through organizational slack, and a tight coupling of evaluation with job tasks. The findings suggest that funders and nonprofits might gain more from investing in internal grantee capacities for lateral communication and coordination than by soliciting more detailed reporting"
1343	2006	NML	17:02	"Interorganizational trust, boundary spanning, and humanitarian relief coordination"	"This article examines the frequently cited argument that coordination issues in humanitarian relief can be addressed more effectively with greater centralized authority and argues for a new conceptualization of aid delivery. The former position suggests a hierarchical, top-down view of the humanitarian relief theater, while this analysis contends that the relief implementation structure may be better conceived as consisting of a network of loosely coupled semiautonomous organizations (Weick, 1976). A network approach allows examination of aid coordination dynamics at multiple levels of analysis: individual (professional and personal), organizational and interorganizational (operational), and strategic (structural/contextual). So viewed, factors that influence relief delivery, including contextual or strategic conditions and organization-scale concerns, may either encourage or dissuade coordination across institutional boundaries. We argue that trust is a key precondition to coordination and that its extension is in turn conditioned by a number of strategic and operating-level factors. We concentrate on operational coordination, as strategic concerns are not often open to the control of lone organizational actors. Our analysis rests in part on in-depth interviews (each consisted of open-ended questions and lasted an average of ninety to one hundred minutes) with a small sample of experienced international nongovernmental organization relief professionals who were engaged in aid efforts in Kosovo following the 1999 intervention by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in that region."
1344	2007	NML	17:03	Building and valuing global brands in the nonprofit sector	"Global nonprofit brands are the world's new super brands (Wootliff and Deri, 2001). Nonprofit organizations command unprecedented levels of trust, and nonprofit brand valuations are on par with major international corporations. Leaders and managers of nonprofits face new challenges in the stewardship of their brands. Based on current thinking in nonprofit management and detailed interviews with close to one hundred executives of ten international nonprofit organizations, this article draws strategic lessons on brand building and brand valuation activities of international nonprofits. The multiple roles and stakeholders that global nonprofit brands must address make nonprofit brand building complex and challenging. In particular, differences between advocacy and relief organizations must be explained. Despite the complexity, international nonprofit organizations may have an advantage over for-profits in leveraging public trust and brand communication. Advocacy organizations in particular successfully link brand and cause to good effect. The valuation of nonprofit brands is a new strategic challenge with significant appeal, but also significant concerns for international nonprofits. In addition to providing nonprofit leaders and managers with a better understanding of brand-building activities, imperatives, and best practices in the field, this article outlines the opportunities and threats associated with the valuation of nonprofit brands."
1345	2007	NML	17:03	Differences in perceived barriers to volunteering to formal organizations: Lack of time versus lack of interest	"This article reports the findings of a study of perceived barriers to volunteering to formal organizations by nonvolunteers. We examine the types of barriers, their frequencies, and their relationships with individual-level sociodemographic characteristics of nonvolunteers. Data from a 2001 2002 national survey conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics are analyzed using multiple regression techniques. Contrary to general expectations, only three barriers lack of time, lack of interest, and ill health are fairly common. Furthermore, as expected, different social class groups identify different types of barriers. The article concludes with a discussion of the theoretical implications of the findings (for example, how indicators of social and cultural capital affect access to volunteer opportunities) and practical implications concerning recruitment of volunteers."
1346	2007	NML	17:03	Board development practices and competent board members: Implications for performance	"This study explores underlying assumptions about board development practices in nonprofit governance. Specifically, a model was developed to determine if using recommended recruitment, board member orientation, and evaluation practices resulted in more competent board members and if the presence of these board members led to better board performance. The sample consisted of 1,051 survey responses from CEOs and board chairs representing 713 credit unions. As member-benefit nonprofit organizations, credit unions rely almost exclusively on voluntary board members in an oversight capacity. Results support the contention that board development practices lead to more capable board members, and the presence of these board members tends to explain board performance. The study advances the understanding of nonprofit board development practices by further defining the concept and proposing an empirically tested assessment strategy. Furthermore, the findings support using specific recruitment practices that should strengthen nonprofit boards."
1347	2007	NML	17:03	Nonprofit agency dependence on direct service and indirect support volunteers: An empirical investigation	"Thirty agency directors or volunteer coordinators were interviewed regarding the human resource techniques they use to attract and retain two types of volunteers: direct service and indirect support. Agencies that depend on direct (point-of-service) volunteers are more likely to bring volunteers on board and use the performance feedback process to guide any needed improvements. Role playing and mentoring are particularly effective training techniques for these volunteers. Despite the critical function of point-of-service volunteers, more sophisticated recruitment and screening techniques were not used, contrary to expectations. Agencies that depend on indirect support volunteers use the recruitment process to screen out those who would not be successful volunteers and terminate them quickly for lack of confidentiality and reliability, particularly if they have had on-the-job training. Agencies hesitate to terminate direct service volunteers even for lack of ability and violations of policies and procedures. Finally, agencies used nonmonetary rewards with indirect support, but not direct service, volunteers. Implications of these findings and others are discussed."
1348	2007	NML	17:04	To profit or not to profit: Women entrepreneurs in India	"Entrepreneurial activity attracts certain kinds of individuals, whether it is to promote a social cause in the nonprofit sector or profit in the for-profit sector. This article looks at the behavior of women entrepreneurs in India in both the for-profit and nonprofit sectors to test for potential differences and similarities. We chose two groups of entrepreneurial women who founded and led relatively similar-size organizations in the same city and who provided services primarily to women and children. Our findings show that while all nonprofit entrepreneurs receive a high payoff from promoting social causes, there is no single unifying payoff for for-profit entrepreneurs. Family background and support, however, play an important role for both sets of entrepreneurs. We find that experience in the sector, social class, caste, and education influence entrepreneurial behavior and that this influence differs by sector."
1349	2007	NML	17:04	Managing electronic documents and work flows: Enterprise content management at work in nonprofit organizations	"Web management and knowledge management systems have made significant technological advances, culminating in large information management systems such as enterprise content management (ECM). ECM is a Web-based publishing system that manages large numbers of electronic documents and other Web assets intended for publication to Web portals and other complex Web sites. Work in nonprofit organizations can benefit from adopting new communication technologies that promote collaboration and enterprise-wide knowledge management. The unique characteristics of ECM are enumerated and analyzed from a knowledge management perspective. We identify three stages of document life cycles in ECM implementations content, reification, and commodification/process as the content management model. We present the model as a mechanism for decision makers and scholars to use in evaluating the organizational impacts of systems such as ECM. We also argue that decision makers in nonprofit organizations should take care to avoid overly commodifying business processes in the final stage, where participation may be more beneficial than efficiency."
1350	2007	NML	17:04	Fractals of strategic coherence in a successful nonprofit organization	"We theorize that organizations that are able to use stories and examples to explain their strategy and offer a flexible guide to discretionary employee behaviors use them in what can be termed a fractal fashion. The thesis is based on the idea of how strategic logic can be communicated and how it can be reiterated to lead to strategic coherence across different levels of analysis in organizations. The parallels of a nonlinear, reinforcing process that is based on iteration inspired us to draw on complexity theory and fractal processes to understand the generation of strategic coherence. We present the case of a successful nonprofit organization where it appears that such a fractal use of stories occurred."

It also looks at this policy's impact on public and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that provide court-related services. Because the passing of the referendum is in many ways a reflection of the changing role of the Catholic church in public life, considerable attention is granted to the evolving nature of this institution, from policymaker to service provider. Implications include how Catholic NGOs partner with public institutions in providing services to families experiencing divorce."
1352	2007	NML	18:01	"Street lamps, alleys, ratio analysis, and nonprofit organizations"	"This article offers an accounting-based framework for evaluating the efficiency of nonprofit organizations using four factors. Separately, these factors reflect (1) the proportion of revenues actually used in the current year, (2) the proportion of the expenditures allocated to programs, (3) the units of output produced from that spending, and (4) the value of the units produced, expressed in terms of an index value. Combined, these four factors measure the value of units produced per dollar of revenue received, an accounting measure of overall efficiency. Using this framework provides insight into both the appropriateness and the limitations of employing solely financial measures to judge nonprofit organizations and also identifies conceptual areas absent from currently available evaluation tools."
1353	2007	NML	18:01	"Nonprofit association CEOs how their context shapes what, how, and why they learn"	"This qualitative study explored the learning experiences of twelve national nonprofit membership association CEOs using a phenomenological research design. While the professional context of an organization's chief executive is considered unique from other executive positions, the impact of this context on what and how CEOs learned was unclear. The findings describe association CEO learning as being affected in significant ways by the politically charged context in which the nonprofit association CEO operates with his or her board of directors. Power imbalances with staff and the board make learning through traditional organizational dialogue a less useful learning process for the CEOs. Furthermore, the feelings of isolation and vulnerability that are generated from the nonprofit association CEO context often cause CEOs to use private reflection and dialogue with their spouse as primary learning mechanisms. The study concludes that the association CEO context uniquely and profoundly shapes what, how, and why CEOs learn. Perhaps lacking the financial security of lucrative severance payments, which are often specified in employment contracts of for-profit CEOs, the nonprofit association CEO will often temper his or her actions to avoid personal vulnerability with a politically charged board of directors."
1354	2007	NML	18:01	The role of social anxiety in volunteering	"The volunteer management literature suggests that the most effective means of recruitment is personal asking. However, agencies that apply this method do not report the expected success in volunteer recruitment. Often they face the volunteer recruitment fallacy: those people assumed to be interested in volunteering do not necessarily volunteer. Based on the literature of shyness or social anxiety and on empirical observations, this article suggests that social anxiety often deters volunteering by new recruits. We hypothesize that people with greater levels of social anxiety will be less likely to volunteer. Furthermore, we hypothesize that people with high social anxiety will prefer to give monetary support to worthy causes rather than volunteer their time, and if they do choose to volunteer, they will do so alongside friends. Our hypotheses are supported based on the findings from a large-scale nonrandom sample in North America. We suggest how to avoid the volunteer recruitment fallacy by creating a personal environment in which high-social-anxiety recruits feel safe and accepted. By removing the fear of being negatively judged by strangers as they enter the agency and creating a more personal approach, new recruits may have a higher probability of becoming long-term and consistent volunteers."
1355	2007	NML	18:01	Nonprofit organizations use of the internet: A content analysis of communication trends on the internet sites of the philanthropy 400	"To evaluate the current status of communication and fundraising strategies on the Internet, a stratified random sample of the Chronicle of Philanthropy's Philanthropy 400 was content-analyzed in mid-January 2005. Web sites were coded on variables identified in practitioner and scholarly literature on issues of accountability, fundraising practices, and interactive communication strategies. Chi-square analysis found that the top nonprofit organizations included copies of their annual reports, organizational goals, and mission statements, while second-tier organizations were more likely to use a sales approach by using e-commerce technology and terminology to process online donations."
1356	2007	NML	18:02	U.S. nonprofit organizations demand for temporary foreign professionals	"This article examines the demand by nonprofits in the United States for foreign professionals to fill a variety of specialized and managerial positions on a temporary basis. Our study contributes to understanding the demand side of the trend toward a more contingent workforce. We test predictors of nonprofit employers pursuit of foreign labor for professional expertise and show an association between strategy to insource foreign labor and organizational resource level, mission, occupational need, and wage offer. Our findings suggest that government visa policies and practices affect labor pools for nonprofit organizations. Given that our study reveals varied interest by nonprofits in pursuing temporary foreign professionals, we end with a brief review and discussion of how the use of temporary and foreign professionals may influence the dynamics of nonprofit organizations and suggest additional research questions."
1357	2007	NML	18:02	The relational determinants of nonprofit Web site fundraising effectiveness: An exploratory study	"In this article, we develop a framework for assessing the relational content of nonprofit Internet sites. We operationalize this as a series of eight relational constructs applicable to the context of Web site design and operation and explore the relationship between the presence of these dimensions and the fundraising performance of nonprofit Web sites. We conclude that accessibility, accountability, education, interaction, and empowerment are significantly correlated with the number of new donors a site is able to attract, and that accessibility, accountability, and education are also highly correlated with the total value of online donations offered."
1358	2007	NML	18:02	An expanded theory of pluralistic interactions in voluntary nonprofit organizations	"Demographic trends suggest a more culturally diverse society, yet research focusing specifically on the management of this diversity in nonprofit organizations is at a nascent stage. Furthermore, traditional ways of conceptualizing cultural diversity in U.S. society are becoming outmoded. Thus, nonprofit managers and leaders can benefit from new ways of thinking about and managing diversity. In this article, we extend our proposed representation interaction model of diversity in voluntaristic nonprofits (Weisinger and Salipante, 2005) by more closely examining the interaction prong of our model in order to provide a more grounded understanding of this new approach to increasing pluralism. The expanded model that we discuss here is founded on interaction processes: in-group identity and recategorization. This study enables us to transform our grounded theory into a theory of practices that leaders of voluntaristic organizations can directly apply. We present findings from a field study of a national nonprofit organization and discuss implications for practice and research."
1359	2007	NML	18:02	Collaborations with faith-based social service coalitions	"Based on the first national survey of faith-based social service coalitions in the United States, this article presents data on the degree to which these nonprofit organizations collaborate with other specific organizational types, as well as the range and intensity of these collaborations. In general, faith-based coalitions tend to collaborate most frequently with other faith-based agencies, a pattern especially characteristic of the more religiously expressive ones. However, collaboration with non-faith-based organizations is also quite common. Based on seven organizational characteristics, we are able to predict which faith-based coalitions are most likely to collaborate with different types of organizations: coalitions that have more explicitly religious policies and practices with reference to clients and staffs are less likely to participate in intense collaborations with some types of secular organizations, and consistently less likely to do so with all types of governmental agencies."
1360	2007	NML	18:02	Urban congregations as incubators of service organizations	"A growing body of research has begun to describe the variety and pervasiveness of community services offered by religious congregations across the United States. This study investigated the process whereby a congregation forms a new community service entity by tracing patterns in its development from formation through emancipation. Based on a sample of twenty-three spin-off organizations engaged in housing services in three cities (Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and St. Louis), this exploratory study found that religious congregations provided very limited forms of incubation for new entities. Although the congregations exhibited considerable involvement in governance, their inability to undertake management of daily spin-off operations notably contributed to the eventual separation between parent and organizational offspring."
1361	2007	NML	18:02	Contributions of unrestricted funds: The donor organization public relationship and alumni attitudes and behaviors	"This exploratory pilot study examined alumni attitudes and behaviors toward making contributions in a nonprofit higher education organizational setting. The theoretical base of the study was that nonprofit higher education organizations operate in competitive marketing environments within a resource dependence open systems framework. In an effort to better understand alumni donor attitudes and behaviors in this context, this research explored the predictive relationship between the donor organization public relationship (OPR) and alumni donor attitudes toward willingness to contribute unrestricted funds and donor behaviors concerning size of gifts made, frequency per year of contributions, and frequency of years of contributions using Huang's (2001) organization public relationship assessment. Results indicate that donor OPR significantly predicts alumni donor attitudes toward willingness to contribute unrestricted funds. The results do not support that donor OPR significantly predicts size of gifts made, frequency per year of contributions, and frequency of years of contributions."
1362	2008	NML	18:03	Three-phase capital campaigns	"The structure of most capital campaigns traditionally contains a private (or quiet) phase and a public phase. Leadership gifts are raised in the first phase, while the general prospect pool is asked to participate in the effort during the public phase. An announcement is made at some point to make the campaign public. A survey of 195 donors reveals that as the campaign nears its end (95 percent completed), donors tend to be much more likely to contribute. This suggests organizing campaigns (in addition to planning and evaluation phases) into three core phases (leadership, growth, and goal line) rather than two phases (quiet and public). The implication for fundraisers is to wait as long as possible (at least to 40 percent of the goal) before moving into the second growth phase. They might also take advantage of the propensity of donors to want to complete the task and reach the goal by implementing a special effort in the final goal line phase. Once the goal is reached, donors are dramatically less likely to continue giving to the campaign."
1363	2008	NML	18:03	Organizational networks of collaboration for community-based living	"This exploratory study of the Texas Community Awareness and Relocation Services (CARS) Project examines organizational networks of collaboration for community-based living. A high degree of collaboration in these networks is needed to help nursing facility residents negotiate the complex process of moving to community-based settings. Social network analysis reveals considerable variations in local organizational networks of collaboration among lead nonprofit providers before and after implementation of the CARS Project in five test sites. These variations probably affected their collaborative capacity of each site and, ultimately, the project's outcomes."
1364	2008	NML	18:03	Nonprofit versus corporate governance: An economic approach	"This article proposes a new theoretical concept of nonprofit governance using transaction cost economics and the economic theory of contracts. After a short review of economic approaches to corporate governance, I clarify the specific nature of the governance problem in nonprofit organizations. Based on this analysis, I derive criteria for selecting an organization's relevant stakeholders. If stakeholders provide valuable specific resources without the protection of a comprehensive contract that details exactly how the organization is to use these resources, then such stakeholders seek decision and control rights in order to direct the use of the resources they have provided. I argue that the core problem of governance is how to enhance valuable specific contributions of the relevant stakeholders while keeping the costs of bargaining between stakeholders and the costs of collective decision making low. The theory developed is then applied in a discussion of practically relevant governance mechanisms, and the concept of governance is used to contribute to the discussion on the strengths and weaknesses of the nonprofit character of organizations from a governance perspective."

The study objectives were to examine whether a glass ceiling exists for women in development in the New England area and develop a historical review of equity progress as compared to previous studies. Issues specific to women in the development field were identified and recommendations given to address identified needs. The findings substantiate the existence of a glass ceiling with a significant difference in average salary and representation in upper management. Furthermore, the study revealed that the salary gap between men and women is widening over time. Perceptions of barriers to women's advancement and organizational practices that would contribute to equity were also assessed. Recommendations for future research and organizational practices are presented."
1366	2008	NML	18:04	Advancing nonprofit organizational effectiveness research and theory: Nine theses	"Drawing on the general literature on organizational effectiveness, the specialized literature on nonprofit organizational effectiveness, and recent research in the field, this article advances nine theses, or conclusions, about the effectiveness of public benefit charitable, nonprofit organizations (NPOs). NPO effectiveness is (1) always comparative, (2) multidimensional, (3) related to board effectiveness (but how is not clear), (4) related to the use of correct management practices but not in any simple best practices way, and (5) a social construction. Furthermore, (6) it is unlikely that there are any universally applicable best practices that can be prescribed for all NPO boards and management, (7) organizational responsiveness is a useful organizational-level effectiveness measure, (8) distinguishing among types of NPOs is important and useful, and (9) level of analysis makes a difference in researching and understanding effectiveness. The article concludes by considering implications for organizational practice, boards and governance practices, program evaluation, including program outcomes assessment, and capacity building and capacity builders."
1367	2008	NML	18:04	Evaluating philanthropic foundations according to their social values	"Philanthropic foundations are seen as enterprises committed to building what they view as a better world. Their visions of a better world are described in terms of social values that represent preferred end states for society or means of achieving such states. This article describes a procedure in which a foundation's espoused social values, made explicit, may serve as a referent to evaluate the foundation's performance. The process by which social values are determined is offered as a means to promote critical and reflective discourse not only within the foundation but with the public, especially those affected by the foundation's work."
1368	2008	NML	18:04	"Determinants of compensation: A study of pay, performance, and gender differences for fundraising professionals"	"This study examines the determinants of compensation for fundraising professionals by addressing the following research questions: (1) Is there a significant pay-performance relationship? (2) What are the factors that affect bonus and salary? (3) Is there a gender-pay gap for individuals who are in the role of fundraisers? Data were collected over a four-year period from a national sample of fundraising professionals employed across all industry classifications. Amount of money raised was the primary performance variable of interest. Bivariate tests for differences between males and females, as well as two-stage simultaneous regressions, were used to determine the effects of fundraising performance on the pay of fundraisers. Results indicated a significant and positive pay-performance linkage across all fundraising positions, particularly for chief development officers, as well as a consistent gender-pay gap across fundraising positions."
1369	2008	NML	18:04	Employee creativity in U.S. and Lithuanian nonprofit organizations	"This article reports findings from a study designed to test a model of creativity in the United States and Lithuania. Five independent variables were derived from the creativity literature: perceived leadership behaviors, organizational norms for creativity, group climate, job characteristics, and motivational orientation. They were used to predict creativity in a sample of 201 employees of nonprofit organizations. The results differed for the two countries. Interestingly, while in the United States organizational norms for creativity, extrinsic motivation, and hierarchical level were related to employee creativity, in Lithuania intrinsic motivation and education constituted major predictors of creativity. Based on the study results, I suggest practical implications for nonprofit managers on how to capitalize on their employees creativity."
1370	2008	NML	19:01	Linking collegiate service-learning to future volunteerism: Implications for nonprofit organizations	"One of the biggest challenges facing nonprofits is attracting and retaining volunteers to help deliver their programs. One way that colleges and universities are attempting to educate students on the importance of community issues and to graduate good citizens is through service-learning (S-L) programs. Although many scholars argue that collegiate S-L programs will increase the extent to which students volunteer following graduation (for example, Astin, Sax, and Avalos, 1999, Misa, Anderson, and Yamamura, 2005), more empirical research has been called for to examine this relationship. This article proposes three predictors of future volunteerism for alumni of a collegiate S-L experience: the amount of personal development experienced during the S-L project, the perceived value of the S-L project to the community organization, and the level of volunteerism prior to participation in an S-L project. Results showed significant effects of all the proposed predictors on postgraduation volunteering. Our findings have implications for nonprofit managers charged with maintaining a sufficient level of volunteers to provide their community services as well as individuals who are responsible for organizing S-L programs. These managerial implications and directions for future S-L research are discussed."
1371	2008	NML	19:01	Collaboration in foundation grantor-grantee relationships	"Foundations take many forms and wield widespread influence within the nonprofit sector. One aspect of foundations that has received limited research attention is the relationship between the foundation and the grantee. Some authors have encouraged a reframing of this relationship to be more one of equals, where each party brings attributes valuable to the other and where collaboration can germinate and produce more effective philanthropy. This exploratory study suggests that the quality of these relationships varies widely and that it is often difficult to form collaborative ones. It identifies some of the earmarks of fruitful relationships and suggests some ways to replicate those successes."
1372	2008	NML	19:01	Determinants of fraud losses in nonprofit organizations	"Although fraud research has increased, the nonprofit setting has been ignored in criminology and business ethics. This exploratory study examines occupational fraud in 128 nonprofit agencies. Characteristics of offenders (age, gender, educational background, position in the agency), victims (size of organization and available control mechanisms), and offenses are compared to previous research. Regression analyses indicate that several factors are significant predictors of financial loss. At the individual level, it appears females are responsible for increased dollar losses, however, subsequent analyses demonstrate that organizations with a higher level of internal controls detect fraud committed by males, and it is these offenses that result in more serious losses."
1373	2008	NML	19:01	The decline of motivation?: From commitment to dropping out of volunteering	"This article studies volunteerism through the phenomenon of dropping out. By ascertaining the achievements, difficulties, and dilemmas of volunteers at the Center for Assistance to Victims of Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence, we explored the process of dropping out as an encore to understanding the meaning of volunteerism that ends with abandoning a desired activity. On the basis of a longitudinal study, we argue that dropping out is not always a product of waning motivation for many volunteers, dropping out was extremely difficult but rather the outcome of unabridged discrepancies between ought and actual experiences. Volunteers expect to feel good about themselves. In contrast, the organization expects them to act as free agents who can independently manage feelings of pain and self-doubt. When such discrepancies between expectations and reality occur, feelings of anger and disappointment set in. As a result, devoted volunteers drop out in order to preserve their positive self-feeling. It is our contention that in order to understand the nature of volunteers dropout and perseverance, close attention should be paid to processes of self-regulation in the context of the specific relations between the volunteers and the organization."
1374	2008	NML	19:01	The British are not coming!: UK higher education and the nonprofit sector	"The rationale for the growth of nonprofit management education in the United States has recently been charted by O'Neill (2005). Ten years previously, the United States and the United Kingdom were at similar levels of development. By 2006 the parallel lines had been broken. Why has nonprofit management education expanded in the United States while provision of graduate education for the voluntary sector in the United Kingdom has stood still? This article explores the factors that have prevented parallel growth in education provision. It argues that the university as an institution, both in terms of its nature and its power structures, is one of those factors. It presents the story of the closing of the world's first voluntary sector course at the London School of Economics and concludes with reflection on the likely future of voluntary sector management education provision in the United Kingdom."
1375	2008	NML	19:02	Fundraising in the new philanthropy environment: The benefits and challenges of working with giving circles	"This article reports on an exploratory study to understand the impact of the new philanthropy on funding recipients by asking nonprofit professionals about their experiences working with giving circles. Giving circles are growing in number across the United States. They are attractive to new philanthropy donors who pool their resources and then decide together where to give them away. They also frequently include social, educational, and volunteer engagement components. Giving circles seem to be an important source of new and expanded resources for nonprofit organizations, but there are both benefits and challenges to working with giving circles that reveal several problematic tensions for nonprofit funding recipients, the philanthropic relationship, and society more broadly."
1376	2008	NML	19:02	Solutions out of context: Examining the transfer of business concepts to nonprofit organizations	"Small nonprofit organizations face a dilemma when applying management theories and techniques developed for large, private businesses. Research evidence suggests both benefits and problems associated with application of these techniques. To avoid potential problems, nonprofit managers commonly limit the selection and transfer of business techniques to those that solve specific problems or appear consistent with nonprofit orientations. One consequence is that business solutions often create unintended negative outcomes that are due to contextual differences between the two types of organizations. One possible solution to this dilemma is adoption of bundles, or configurations, of practices that introduce important contextual checks and balances along with the specific tools and techniques. We explore this option through a critical, participatory ethnographic analysis of a small nonprofit service organization."
1377	2008	NML	19:02	Hispanic charitable giving: An opportunity for nonprofit development	"In 2003, the U.S. Census Bureau indicated that Hispanics had become the largest U.S. minority group. Representing 14 percent of the population, more than forty million Hispanics currently live in the United States and are a growing source of charitable giving. This study uses a national probability sample (n = 3,261) to examine variables that may influence Hispanic charitable giving in the United States to private nonprofit organizations. Logistic regression analyses indicated that Hispanics were eight times more likely to donate to human service organizations when using payroll deduction. In addition, Hispanics who were solicited for a donation by telephone were twice as likely to make a donation to educational organizations as Hispanic donors not solicited by phone. Volunteerism was also a predictor of Hispanic charitable giving. U.S. demographic trends and this study's findings suggest that nonprofit leaders, including those responsible for fundraising in private nonprofit organizations, need to be aware of the opportunities for Hispanic charitable support."
1378	2008	NML	19:02	Best practices in board governance: Evidence from South Carolina	"In June 2003, a large-scale survey was conducted among South Carolina nonprofit agencies to gather information on a range of board governance issues. Some of the survey questions dealt with how each agency's board contributes to the organization. More than 80 percent of the responding agencies were registered as 501(c)(3), with the largest number of respondents in the human services category. Statistical analysis reveals where actual roles differ from best practices as prescribed in the literature. Discussion then focuses on how these trends in governance affect management and operations. In particular, we look at best practice regarding the separation of board and staff duties."
1379	2008	NML	19:02	On the same page: The value of paid and volunteer leaders sharing mental models in churches	"We examine the idea that mental models shared among paid and volunteer leaders are associated with improved financial performance in nonprofit organizations. Our empirical analysis of thirty-seven churches yields evidence that organizations are more effective if paid and volunteer leaders have a shared task mental model that is, if they report similar conceptualizations of organizational goals and decision-making processes. These findings suggest that the extent of leaders agreement on organizational goals and the processes of how decisions are made matter for organizational performance. We argue that it is as important to ensure that everyone is on the same page with regard to goals and how decisions are made as it is to have the right goals or right decision processes in place. Implications for practice and future research on shared mental models are discussed."
1380	2008	NML	19:02	Getting to yes  or no: Nonprofit decision making and interorganizational restructuring	"This article explores the decision-making process nonprofit organizations use to determine whether to pursue merger or other forms of interorganizational restructuring. The research uses a case study design, analyzing four examples of interorganizational restructuring. The findings describe both the structure and the characteristics of the processes used in four cases. The research found that the decision-making processes used in the four cases had several core elements. Participants in restructuring customized decision-making processes to meet their needs, and power dynamics shaped those processes. Findings about the characteristics of the process emphasize the importance of communication and trust. How partners used power affected the decision-making process and had implications for post-merger success. Decision-making processes for cases involving two partners exhibited characteristics that were different from those involving multiple partners. Future research should consider the role of trust in restructuring decisions and the responsibilities of board and staff in the restructuring assessment process."
1381	2009	NML	19:03	Survival in local voluntary associations	"This article uses longitudinal data to explore the antecedents of survival among local voluntary associations. The literature distinguishes between deterministic and voluntaristic accounts of organizational survival. In a deterministic perspective, external selection processes determine whether organizations persevere. In a voluntaristic approach, strategic choices and organizational design are paramount. The analyses show that both perspectives have explanatory power. When it comes to avoiding organizational death, organizations can influence their destiny substantially by being extroverted, selecting a diverse and qualified board, and establishing ties to higher organizational levels."
1382	2009	NML	19:03	The nonprofit leadership deficit: A case for more optimism	"Recent headlines claim that a looming nonprofit leadership crisis will soon be precipitated by retiring baby boomers. Analysis of baby boom demographics, using national census data on the age distribution and other demographic characteristics of top leaders by sector, confirms the aging nonprofit workforce. However, the issue of whether the aging workforce portends a nonprofit leadership crisis, when analyzed within a theoretical framework of supply and demand in the market for nonprofit executives, reveals flaws in most commentaries about the leadership crisis. Workings of the labor market and nonprofit organizations themselves suggest trends that could be expected to affect labor supply and demand and mitigate a leadership deficit. Reasonable and likely market and organizational adjustments, including higher executive pay, increased labor force participation of older workers, skill acquisition of younger workers, possible consolidation of nonprofit organizations, board and volunteer skill sharing, and even venture philanthropy, can be expected to moderate the shock of baby boom retirements, much in the way that schools, job markets, and housing markets have accommodated the movement of this bulging generation through earlier decades of their lives."
1383	2009	NML	19:03	Measuring social values in philanthropic foundations	"Philanthropic foundations are seen as organizations that allocate resources to achieve their visions of a better world. Drawing on a sample of foundations in Canada, the United States, and Europe, this research undertakes to reveal the social values that constitute such visions and to measure the consistency between espoused social values and those conveyed by resource allocations. A social values identification and measurement instrument is described and tested. The social values that comprise the instrument are presented in a chart of social values. A methodology for measuring the consistency between social values espoused by a foundation and those actually conveyed by resource allocation decisions is described, tested, and critiqued. It is argued that the results of this research provide a basis on which to pursue development of a standardized vocabulary of social values that may enhance understanding and discourse regarding the purposes and work of foundations, as well as provide a basis for cross-cultural comparative analyses of foundations."
1384	2009	NML	19:03	Factors affecting member perceptions of coalition impact	"The purpose of this study was to identify attributes of community-based coalitions associated with member perceptions of greater impact. Based on Hackman's model of work group effectiveness, we hypothesized that member effort, knowledge and skill, and performance strategies would affect their perceptions of coalition impact. Findings from a lagged regression on a sample of forty-five youth-oriented coalitions indicated that two aspects of member effort were associated with subsequent perceived impact, as were performance strategies for both coalition governance and community interventions. There were no associations, however, between member knowledge and skill and perceived impact. These results suggest that leaders may improve perceived coalition impact by encouraging member participation in discussions and interventions and by developing effective strategies for both governance and implementation."
1385	2009	NML	19:03	Does meeting standards affect charitable giving? An empirical study of New York metropolitan area charities	"Charitable donations constitute a significant revenue source for many nonprofit organizations. To help donors decide which nonprofits to support, watchdog organizations such as the Better Business Bureau (BBB) Wise Giving Alliance have developed standards to promote wise giving. The effectiveness of these guides in channeling limited resources to the best-managed nonprofits is not widely studied. This research attempts to empirically investigate the effects of standards on public giving, controlling for factors that have documented effects on donations. Specifically, it regresses public support on the extent to which local nonprofits meet the standards of the Better Business Bureau Serving Metropolitan New York, Mid-Hudson and Long Island Regions, controlling for organization size, board size, service category, government funding, fundraising expense, and giving price. The study found that BBB standards have a positive effect on giving behavior. Meeting BBB standards is associated with higher levels of public support. Participating in assessment programs and striving to meet the standards are recommended for nonprofits seeking to improve funding through charitable contributions. Further study that extends the search for the mechanism that links meeting standards to improved donations is recommended."
1386	2009	NML	19:04	Variation in part-time job quality within the nonprofit human service sector	"This article extends the growing literature on the quality of part-time employment to the domain of nonprofit human services, specifically grassroots organizations in which paid work is itself a relatively new reality. It addresses three central questions: How do part-time and full-time workers differ in their personal and household characteristics? How do part-time jobs differ in access to employment benefits from their full-time counterparts, and finally, How does benefits access vary among part-time job titles? These lines of inquiry are examined using data from the populations of nonprofit domestic violence programs and their employees in a large midwestern metropolitan area. Analyses of worker-level data reveal that part-time workers in these settings disproportionately live with children, are in committed relationships, and report a strong preference for employment that facilitates work-life balance, they are also less likely to be primary household wage earners. Analyses at the level of jobs suggest that employment benefits extended to part-time jobs are minimal compared to their full-time equivalents, but there are also striking variations among different part-time titles. The results offer insights into the nature of part-time work in these nonprofit human service settings and potential challenges for effective management."
1387	2009	NML	19:04	A critical cross-cultural perspective for developing nonprofit international management capacity	"Issues of the effectiveness of international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are becoming critical among a claim that cultural sensitivity to people's needs and the appropriateness of interventions is a competitive advantage of the sector. Here, the cross-cultural management agenda is set out, particularly in terms of the transferability or appropriateness of management knowledge and development interventions. Research propositions are presented that, if supported through future empirical findings, suggest cultural hybridization is a process that can be managed through greater stakeholder involvement, leading to greater appropriateness as well as effectiveness of international NGOs."
1388	2009	NML	19:04	"Keeping up with the Joneses: The relationship of perceived descriptive social norms, social information, and charitable giving"	"We study the influence of perceived descriptive social norms on subsequent giving behavior to nonprofits, explore how social information can influence these norms, and provide insight for fundraising practice. A survey conducted in a nonprofit organization first shows that donors use their beliefs about the descriptive social norm to inform their own donation behavior. Donors who believe that others make high contributions tend to make high contributions themselves. Next, a laboratory experiment demonstrates the influence of social information on the descriptive social norm and consequently on giving. These results suggest strategies for fundraising practice. Informing donors of contributions made by another person influences their perceptions about the descriptive social norm, which in turn influences their giving behavior. We conclude with a discussion of theoretical and practical implications."
1389	2009	NML	19:04	The economic value of volunteers to nonprofit organizations	"This article applies microeconomic theory to the problem of calculating the economic value of volunteers to nonprofit organizations. It finds weaknesses in two popular valuation metrics: replacement cost and demand price. It argues for a method that measures the economic value of volunteer time by the impact it has on an organization's revenue, through either fundraising or producing goods and services. An Australian case study illustrates the method, and a survey of U.S. nonprofits tests the generality of the assumptions. The concluding section offers suggestions for management practice and further research."
1390	2009	NML	19:04	"Put me in, Coach: A pilot evaluation of executive coaching in the nonprofit sector"	The use of executive coaching within the nonprofit sector has received increased attention over the past decade as a mechanism to build capacity and address issues of burnout and turnover among executives. This article presents the results of an evaluation of a pilot six-month executive coaching program that was implemented in 2005 in an urban metropolitan area. The evaluation collected data through surveys and semistructured interviews with nine executive directors and five coaches who participated in the pilot and analyzed the data to assess the effectiveness of the delivery and usefulness of the experience. The coaching experience was rated as very helpful and supportive of the development of executive directors as nonprofit leaders.
1391	2009	NML	20:01	The social processes of interorganizational collaboration and conflict in nonprofit organizations	"This article takes a qualitative approach to research in advancing knowledge of the social process by which interorganizational relationships are established and nurtured in nonprofit organizations. The findings reveal that a balance of dependence and autonomy is needed for initiating interorganizational relationships. These relationships are stabilized at the interpersonal level through positive attributes (attitudes, perceptions, and trust) and interpersonal ties of individuals representing their organizations. Sources of conflict, such as value differences, divergent goals, and personality clashes, also influence the working relationships of these organizations."
1392	2009	NML	20:01	Strategic group membership and nonprofit organization performance	"This study analyzed the resource characteristics of a sample of university foundations and identified five distinct strategic groups. We found significant performance differences among them. Specifically, the group that focused most heavily on fundraising activities had the highest financial performance. Also performing well was the group with the highest ratio of contributions to total revenues combined with the highest level of slack. The research and managerial implications of this study's findings are discussed."
1393	2009	NML	20:01	"Transformational and transactional leadership styles, followers positive and negative emotions, and performance in German nonprofit orchestras"	"Although the transformational-transactional leadership paradigm has received increased attention from the research community over the past two decades, the nonprofit sector has been largely neglected. This study provides information about the effectiveness of transformational and transactional leadership styles in the domain of German nonprofit orchestras, while exploring the role of emotions within these leadership styles. We examined musicians perceptions of their orchestra conductors leadership behaviors and related those behaviors to performance. Positive emotions were associated with both transactional and transformational leadership. Negative emotions partially mediated the influence of transformational leadership on performance. In combination, the results allow a more thorough and detailed understanding of effective leadership behavior in nonprofit organizations."
1394	2009	NML	20:01	A contingency approach to nonprofit governance	"A number of contingency factors may be relevant for effective nonprofit organizations and their boards. Although all boards must fulfill certain critical roles and responsibilities, strategic choices can be made about adopting different governance configurations or patterns. These choices can be meaningfully informed by understanding organizational contingencies such as age, size, structure, and strategy and, even more important, by external contingencies and environmental dimensions such as degree of stability and complexity. This article extends or layers contingency thinking beyond its traditional focus on an alignment between the external environment and the organization's structure to focus as well on the alignment of the organization's governance configuration with its structure and environment. Structural contingency theory in general, and specifically within nonprofits, is reviewed. Two cases are presented of organizations that used an approach based on contingency theory in an action research process to examine and change their governance configurations. The steps they followed may help other nonprofits adapt their governance structures and practices and fulfill their responsibilities for board assessment and reflection."
1395	2009	NML	20:01	To be a business and to keep our humanity: A critical management studies analysis of the relationship between a funder and nonprofit community organizations	"In recent years, the political nature of nonprofit funding has been well established, with research focusing on increased demands for accountability (Eikenberry and Kluver, 2004), difficulties in selecting accountability measures (Reed, Jones, and Irvine, 2005), and the shift from organizational mission that can occur while trying to adhere to funding requirements (Adcroft and Willis, 2005, Parsons and Broadbridge, 2004). This article examines the dynamics between a funder and the nonprofit organizations it funds within an evolving accountability process. Specifically, we use qualitative methods to examine the negotiations between the funder and the nonprofits. Both sides in the funding relationship face tensions as they attempt to work within the constraints of this specific funding regime while trying to maintain their focus on social justice outcomes."
1396	2009	NML	20:01	Patterns of governance structures in trade associations and unions	"Most research on the governance of nonprofit organizations concentrates on welfare-oriented organizations and disregards other types of nonprofits. This article examines the governance structures of trade associations and unions as a special type of nonprofit organization. Analysis is based on a qualitative case study survey of thirty Swiss trade associations. The results distinguish four categories of governance: satellite governance, delegate governance, executive governance, and inner-circle governance."
1397	2009	NML	20:02	Corporate governance in nonprofit organizations. A nontechnical review of the economic literature	"The economics-based theoretical and related empirical literature on the governance of nonprofit organizations is brought together and integrated in a way easily accessible for noneconomists. This literature is scattered in academic journals covering economics, health economics, management, and accounting, and in the more nonprofit-geared research publications. After defining corporate governance, I present in a nontechnical way the most appropriate economic framework for studying governance problems: the principal-agent theory. Most of the economic literature deals with the role and influence of the board and its relation to the organization's management and performance. This is reflected in the article's structure. The board's functioning, composition, and committee structure are first discussed, followed by a review of the literature on incentive-based remuneration schemes, disclosure of financial information, and the use of debt to mitigate agency problems between the board and management. The literature dealing with donors and subsidizing authorities in governance relations is then presented. The article concludes with a number of practical implications of the scholarly obtained results to date, as well as some suggestions for further theoretical and empirical research."
1398	2009	NML	20:02	Agency conflicts between board and manager: A discrete choice experiment in Flemish nonprofit schools	"Detecting agency problems is an important task when assessing the effectiveness of a nonprofit organization's governance. A first step is to examine the objectives of principals and agents and determine whether there is a systematic difference between them. Using a discrete choice experiment, we identify the objectives of board chairpersons (principals) and headmasters (agents) of Flemish nonprofit schools. We find systematic differences between the two groups. Of the seven possible objectives set out in the experiment, six are relevant for both headmasters and board chairpersons. For four of these, the preferences of both groups differ significantly. Whereas ideological values play an important role for both the board and the headmaster, they are significantly more important for the board. Both parties dislike having a large number of pupils, and the disutility is larger for the board. With respect to job satisfaction and pupil satisfaction, we find the opposite: while the board is prepared to give up pupil and job satisfaction in favor of the other objectives, these two objectives score very high on the priority list of the headmasters."
1399	2009	NML	20:02	Leadership succession and the emergence of an organizational identity threat	"Leadership succession, and the associated changes that new leaders make, can have profound impacts on nonprofit organizations. Despite its importance, there is limited research that examines succession from the point of view of employees and considers how their interpretations of organizational identity and proposed change shape their responses to leadership transitions. In this article, we examine the dynamics that ensued when the founder of Friends of the Earth, a nonprofit environmental organization, stepped down. The case shows how the succession process can expose latent disagreement about an organization's identity and give rise to internal conflict. These patterns suggest that leaders must be attentive to different and often conflicting interpretations of an organization's identity."
1400	2009	NML	20:02	"Structure, power, and discourses of development in Spanish NGOs"	"Because of its recent and rapid growth, the Spanish development apparatus provides an appropriate arena for studying nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). This article uses case studies of three NGOs Manos Unidas, IntermÑn Oxfam, and Madre Corajeto explore the tension between the internal and external dynamics that affect these organizations. Although powerful external forces promote structural isomorphism with its attendant bureaucratization and professionalization, several internal factors youth, small size, certain ideologies, charismatic leaders, and privileging identification with the organization rather than expertise when recruiting participants resist these homogenizing processes. DiMaggio and Powell's iron cage hypothesis (1983) therefore can be only partially confirmed. We suggest an intriguing, intimate connection between charisma and democracy."
1401	2010	NML	20:03	Beyond taxonomy: An empirical validation of social entrepreneurship in the nonprofit sector	"Much of the considerable confusion about the definition of social entrepreneurship in academic literature stems from a lack of empirical research on the subject. This article advances social entrepreneurship research beyond conceptualization discussions by developing and validating an instrument that quantifies the incidence of nonprofit entrepreneurial behavior. Information from 145 Kansas City Metropolitan Area nonprofit organizations was collected to validate the underlying constructs represented in the instrument. Behavior differences were depicted between entrepreneurial and nonentrepreneurial nonprofits. Using principal component factor analysis, the research illustrates social entrepreneurship as a unique nonprofit behavior that occurs at the intersection of innovation, proactiveness, and risk taking."
1402	2010	NML	20:03	The role of the YMCA in the origins of U.S. nonprofit management education	"The given narrative of the origins of nonprofit management education tends to begin in the 1970s or 1980s, recognizing earlier efforts that were limited to individual professional disciplines, such as social work administration. This historical inquiry examines whether the origins of generic nonprofit management education can be traced further back. It identifies the 1911 bachelor of association science degree from the Chicago YMCA College as at least a proto-nonprofit management degree and a 1935 text by Ordway Tead, issued by the YMCA's publishing house, as a contender for the first text in generic nonprofit management."
1403	2010	NML	20:03	Green matters? An exploration of environmental performance in the nonprofit sector	"Although the environmental impact of nonprofit organizations is likely significant, those in the sector seem to have largely ignored this fact. We examine a model of environmental performance for corporations and consider its relevance to nonprofit organizations. Our analysis suggests that motivators of environmental performance in nonprofit organizations remain minor, and that countervailing barriers to green behavior by nonprofits remain more significant than those faced by businesses."
1404	2010	NML	20:03	How might servant leadership work?	"This study examines the mechanics of servant leadership, particularly how it enhances organizational citizenship and how that drives organizational effectiveness. A case study of three successful Catholic parishes identified three direct leadership mechanisms invitation, inspiration, and affection that evoke and nurture the service of others. The case analysis also identified two organizational leadership mechanisms culture building and structural initiatives through which servant leaders fostered organizational citizenship. This study contributes to an understanding of organizational effectiveness by suggesting how leaders might foster the growth and development of others, build servant-oriented organizations, and improve overall organizational performance."
1405	2010	NML	20:03	Building a better workplace for teen volunteers through inclusive behaviors	"Facing a decline in the number of hours donated to nonprofit organizations, volunteer coordinators must strive to determine the most effective strategies for retaining volunteers. Relationship management theory provides a framework to gauge the well-being of an organization's relationship with its stakeholders. Through surveys administered to 317 teenage volunteers at three library systems, this study found that of four factors trust, commitment, satisfaction, and control mutuality trust had the strongest ability to predict intent to continue volunteering. Further analysis revealed that trust could be enhanced by including teenagers in work groups throughout the organization, seeking their input on organizational decisions, and ensuring they receive formal and informal organizational communications."

From this analysis, the article makes three points. First, philanthropic relationships are not equivalent to accountability relationships. Second, because of these differences funders that adopt performance measurement may encounter tensions as these new practices challenge the importance of other philanthropic concerns. Third, without a systematic way to attend to these concerns when adopting performance measurement, funders face an impoverished choice: reward measurable results or fall back on supporting good intentions."

We explore the role that partnership characteristics play in the effectiveness of these networks. Using data on children and family services in Los Angeles County, we consider the impact of both the motivations for forming partnerships and the nature of the resulting partnerships on perceived outcomes for clients, interorganizational relationships, and organizational learning. We find that client outcomes and interorganizational relationships are enhanced when partnerships are formed to meet certain programmatic and organizational goals. Organizational learning, however, is affected only when partnerships are formed to enhance organizational legitimacy. Partners selected because they share common vision increase effectiveness, while those selected because there are few alternative partners decrease effectiveness. Finally, when partnerships use an interorganizational coordination mechanism, client outcomes are improved. The managerial implications of these impacts for the nonprofit sector are developed. The results lend considerable support to the role of partnership motivation and partner selection in the effectiveness of nonprofit lead-organization networks, and specificity about the nature of that role"

Research on volunteers and volunteerism traditionally focuses on antecedents to volunteering and outcomes for volunteers. In this study, we attempt to build on the existing literature by examining the volunteer experience from the paid employee's vantage point. Using a sample of employees who work alongside volunteers in animal care organizations (N = 270), we examine how employees described the volunteers with whom they interact. Although these assessments were generally positive, there was considerable variability. This appears to be explained, in part, by each organization's volunteer resources management practices. Results also indicate that employees who reported less satisfactory experiences with volunteers also reported being more stressed, overworked, and less committed to the organization, and having a greater intention to quit. Importantly, these results held up even after controlling for general job satisfaction. Implications of these findings for theory and practice are discussed."

The respondents were 2,710 Christian church attendees from nineteen denominations across Australia. They were surveyed with a closed-answer questionnaire covering the topics of faith, demographics, involvement in the congregation, and involvement in the wider community. The results revealed a positive relationship between bonding and bridging social capital, with a high level of bonding associated with a high level of bridging for all denominations and faith identities. There was no evidence that high bonding within the congregation restricted bridging beyond the congregation. The results support the notion that the relationship between bonding and bridging may vary with societal subcultures."
1410	2010	NML	21:01	Why engage: Understanding the incentive to build nonprofit capacity	"Foundations, consultants, and nonprofit managers have become interested in learning more about how to create effective strategies and interventions to strengthen nonprofit management and organizational capacity. In this article, we examine the extent to which organizational theory can explain the motivation to engage in different types of capacity-building efforts. Using data gathered from focus groups and interviews with nonprofit executives, foundation executives, and capacity-building professionals, we illustrate that while different organizational theories can explain the incentive to engage in capacity building, no single theory can truly capture the complexity of the decision-making process. We show how a multitheoretical approach not only allows us to explain the evolution of capacity-building efforts over time, but also helps us to identify and explain the problems that can be created by misinterpreting the incentive to engage in building individual and institutional capacity."

But how do NGO government relationships emerge in practice, and is it possible for NGOs to manage multiple strategies of interaction at once? This article examines the experience of three leading NGOs in Mumbai, India, involved in slum and squatter housing. We investigate how they began relating with government agencies during their formative years and the factors that shaped their interactions. We find that NGOs with similar goals end up using very different strategies and tactics to advance their housing agendas. More significant, we observe that NGOs are likely to employ multiple strategies and tactics in their interactions with government. Finally, we find that an analysis of strategies and tactics can be a helpful vehicle for clarifying an organization's theory of change."

Using hierarchical linear modeling analysis, we can understand the effects of these ratios both within and across foundation grant portfolios. We found statistically significant evidence that grantees with higher debt ratios and higher fundraising ratios receive lower grant amounts. We did not find statistically significant impacts for administrative ratios, revenue diversification, and surplus margin."

This article examines the factors that draw individuals to work in the nongovernmental organization (NGO) sector in the developing countries of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Lebanon, and Sri Lanka. It also looks at whether faith offers similar motivations for NGO workers in Buddhist, Druze, Sunni Muslim, and Shiite Muslim NGOs as it does for workers in Christian NGOs. Much like nonprofit workers in other studies, the individuals interviewed chose their jobs based on their personal commitment to an organization's work."

It is the necessary first step required for innovation, which provides agencies with the upper hand in many areas of organizational management. It has been suggested that certain work environments can contribute to increased levels of creativity. So it is important that the managers of nonprofit organizations have tools that allow them to develop a work context that enhances employee creativity. This article presents a study where one such tool concept mapping was used in the process of transforming a work environment. Qualitative and quantitative data showed that the transformation efforts contributed to major changes in the organization's culture, leadership's attitudes and behaviors, coworker relationships, and the physical work environment, which in turn contributed to positive organizational outcomes."

Examining the African American family foundation	"This article develops a basic knowledge of African American family foundations from which additional research can be generated. It addresses the following questions: From what types of professional backgrounds do the founders of African American family foundations hail? In which areas of the country are African American family foundations located? What is the range of assets possessed by African American family foundations, and how are these assets managed? How do African American family foundations use board members, employees, and volunteers to support their organizations? What are the overarching goals of African American family foundations? And in what areas are they concentrating their donations?"

We know little about these organizations, including how they emerged, formalized, met constituents expectations for immediate performance, and ultimately survived. This article explores these issues through a case study of one successful organization, the Windows of Hope Family Relief Fund. Using concepts from disaster, organizational ecology, and entrepreneurship research, the analysis identifies six propositions that link these literatures, notably the role of resource acquisition in formalization and the role of legitimacy in both fund development and organizational endurance. The study contributes new knowledge about the role of collaboration in acquiring capacity to enhance responsiveness. The findings suggest potential parallels to the evolution of new nonprofit organizations in other contexts"

Using establishment-level data on for-profit and nonprofit organizations, we show that the proportions of women in full-time and mission-critical positions are higher in nonprofits. In contrast, for-profit businesses have more women in part-time jobs and in jobs that are peripheral to the organizational purpose. We also demonstrate that the greater proportions of women in full-time and mission-critical positions in nonprofits are due to the use of inclusive work processes and transparent human resource management practices. Our findings provide evidence to pursue the aspects of nonprofit organizations that expand opportunities for working women."

This approach assumes that a program's initial design is immune to the influence of external forces and is based entirely on sound evidence, theory, and practice. Using a permanent supportive housing program for domestic violence victims as a case study, this research examines how external influences may affect program theory and design and evaluates whether such influences are perceived as opportunities or barriers by program administrators. Findings, based on document review, stakeholder interviews, and focus groups, reveal that funding and physical site characteristics, and to a lesser degree, community support and professional standards, were important external influences. Both opportunities and barriers affected program design, but these effects differed in timing and degree."
